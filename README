= The NTPsec distribution base directory =

This directory and its subdirectories contain NTPSec, a
security-hardened implementation of Network Time Protocol Version 4
(NTP) for Unix systems.

The contents of the base directory are given in this file. The contents of
subdirectories are usually given in the README files in each subdirectory.

A complete explanation of the configure, compile and install process, as
well as setting up an NTP subnet, is in the HTML pages in the ./html/
directory.

The base directory ./ contains the configuration files, source
directories and related stuff:

INSTALL::	Generic installation instructions for autoconf-based programs.
		Unless you really know what you are doing, you should read the
		directions in the HTML pages, starting with ./html/index.html.
		For Windows/NT, visit html/build/hints/winnt.html

NEWS::		What's new in this release.

README::	This file.

devel-docs/::	Documentation aimed at developers.

conf/::		Directory containing a motley collection of
		configuration files for various systems. For example only.

docs/::		Directory containing a complete set of documentation on
		building and configuring a NTP server or client. The files
		are in asciidoc markup.  This replaces the 'html' directory
		of precious versions, but html can be generated from it.

include/::	Directory containing include header files used by most
		programs in the distribution.

lib/::		Source code for third-party libraries included in the
		distribution.  Currently just one: isc, utility code
		from Internet Systems Consortium.  The local copy has
		been significantly modified.

libjsmn/::	A minimal JSON library used by the GPSD-JSON driver.

libntp/::	Directory containing library source code used by most
		programs in the distribution.

libparse/:: 	This directory contains the files making up the parser for
		the parse refclock driver. For reasonably sane clocks
		this refclock drivers allows a refclock implementation
		by just providing a conversion routine and the
		appropriate NTP parameters

ntpd/::		Sources for the main time-synchronization daemon.

ntpdate/::	Directory containing sources for a program to set the
		local machine time from one or more remote machines
		running NTP.  Operates like rdate, but much more accurate.

ntp-keygen::
		Directory containing the utility program used to generate
		NTP authentication keys.

ntpq/::		Directory containing sources for a utility program to
		query local and remote NTP peers for state variables and
		related timekeeping information. This program conforms
		to Appendix A of the NTP Version 3 Specification RFC 1305.

ports/::	Subdirectories of this contain code for non-Unix operating
		systems.  At present there is just one, for Windows.

scripts/::	Directory containing scripts to build the configuration
		files in this directory and then the makefiles used in
		various dependent directories. the subdirectories
		monitoring and support hold various perl and shell
		scripts for visualizing synchronization and daemon startup.

sntp/::		Query an NTP or SNTP server to report or set the time.

tests/::	Self-test code.

util/::		Directory containing sources for various utility and
		testing programs.

waf::		A copy of the waf builder.  This is the engine used to configure
		and build the codebase.

wscript::	NTP-specific waf rules.
