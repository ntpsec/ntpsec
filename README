= The NTPsec distribution base directory =

This directory and its subdirectories contain NTPSec, a
security-hardened implementation of Network Time Protocol Version 4.

The contents of the base directory are given in this file. The contents of
subdirectories are usually given in the README files in each subdirectory.

A complete explanation of the configure, compile and install process, as
well as setting up an NTP subnet, is in the HTML pages in the ./html/
directory.

The base directory ./ contains the configuration files, source
directories and related stuff:

INSTALL::	Generic installation instructions.

NEWS::		What's new in this release.

README::	This file.

VERSION::	The version stamp, to be used by scripts and programs.

attic/:: 	Directory containing source code that is *not* part of a
		normal installation. Things can disappear from here at any
		time.

contrib/::	Directory containing contributed scripts, dragons dwell here.
		Some of this might eventually move to being supported code.

devel/::	Documentation and small tools aimed at developers.
		Includes a hacking guide and a tour of the internals.

docs/::		Directory containing a complete set of documentation on
		building and configuring a NTP server or client. The files
		are in asciidoc markup.  This replaces the 'html' directory
		of previous versions, but html can be generated from it.

etc/::		Directory containing a motley collection of configuration files
		and launch scripts for various systems. For example
		only.

include/::	Directory containing include header files used by most
		programs in the distribution.

libisc/::	Utility code from Internet Systems Consortium.  The local
		copy has been significantly trimmed and modified.

libjsmn/::	A minimal JSON library used by the GPSD-JSON driver.

libntp/::	Directory containing library source code used by most
		programs in the distribution.

libparse/:: 	This directory contains the files making up the parser for
		the parse refclock driver. For reasonably sane clocks
		this refclock drivers allows a refclock implementation
		by just providing a conversion routine and the
		appropriate NTP parameters

ntpclients/::   Directory containing sources for clients - utility programs
		to query local and remote NTP installations for log status,
		state variables, and other timekeeping information.  The term
		"clients" is used quite loosely here; any tool that is not a
		not a multi-file C program probably lives in this directory.

ntpd/::		Sources for the main time-synchronization daemon.

ntpfrob/::      The ntpfrob utility collects several small diagnostic
		functions for reading and tweaking the local clock
		hardware, including reading the clock tick rate,
		precision, and jitter.

ntptime/:: 	Directory containing a utility for reading and modifying
		kernel parameters related to the local clock.

pylib/::	Installable Python helper classes for scripts.

tests/::	Self-test code.

waf::		A copy of the waf builder.  This is the engine used to configure
		and build the codebase.

wafhelpers/::	A library of Python procedures used by the waf build system.

wscript::	NTP-specific waf rules.
