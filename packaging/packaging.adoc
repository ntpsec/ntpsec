= Guidance for package builders =

== Package parts ==

Some useful components for package building can be found in the etc/
subdirectory, including init boot time scripts, systemd unit files,
and boilerplate for default ntpd configuration.

== ntp.conf installation ==

Installation from source (waf install) does not attempt to put an ntp.conf
or ntp.d in place. Your installable package should do this.

The reason this is so is that NTPsec does not yet have an authorized
pool group of its own. This may change in the future.

== Platforms without Python ==

Many tools (actually, almost everything except the core daemon itself)
have been moved from C to Python. This is an important step for
improving maintainability and reducing attack surface.  However, we
know that some platforms cannot support Python or choose not to
include it in their core configuration.

For these platforms, we recommend using cx_Freeze to render the NTPsec
Python programs, and all their imported modules, into standalone files.
These files can then be copied to a host that does not have Python
installed and executed just as if Python was installed.

cx_Freeze documentation lives
http://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[here].

Your OS package manager may have a package for cx_Freeze.  If not you
can install it with pip like this:

```
pip install cx_Freeze
````

You may find that you also need to install the package 'patchelf'.

Change to the root directory of the NTPsec source distribution and
run the following command:

```
waf cxfreeze
```

Binary executables corresponding to every Python script will now be in
the directory named dist along with the other files required for them
to run.

You can copy the dist directory, and its contents, to a host that does
not have Python installed and execute the programs there.

There appears to be no speed advantage, or disadvantage, to running the
binaries created by cx_freeze.

== Hacking Python shebangs ==

The shebang lines in our Python scripts point to "python".  Part of
our standard tests check that you can change that to "python3" without
breaking anything.

We are aware that the Python 3 transition is well advanced.  We are
also aware that PEP394 strongly urges all distributors to point
'python' at Python 2.

This leaves us with a choice to either (a) change the shebangs to
python3 ourselves, causing breakage to users stuck with Python 2
and installing from source, or (b) not change them, leaving it up
to distro maintainers to hack them in whatever way is appropriate for
their distro's Python policy.

We think the choice that minimizes overall pain, and directs it to
the party best able to cope, is clear.  We choose (b).

== Cross-era interoperability in modular calendar arithmetic ==

The protocol necessarily uses time/date stamps of finite length in
order to fit into fixed-size fields; they happen to have a 136-year
cycle, but the problems this produces aren't dependent on the specific
cycle length.  Thus, each instance of ntpd speaks time based on a
specific epoch (cycle start date).  The epoch of era 0 was at the
beginning of 1900; the epoch of era 1 will be in 2036.

Two instances talking to each other have no way to know that they're
based in the same era. To mitigate this problem, each instance
has a pivot date and resolves incoming timestamps to the era that
minimizes distance between now and the timestamp.  This procedure
is part of the core protocol specification.

An instance's pivot time is constructed from BUILD_EPOCH defined at
configure time in config.h.  If BUILD_EPOCH is set to a known time
then the binaries are reproducible.  By default the BUILD_EPOCH is the
time when the last './waf configure' was run.  You can override the
BUILD_EPOCH with './waf configure --build-epoch' or using the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
environment variable.

https://reproducible-builds.org/[https://reproducible-builds.org/]

== Disambiguation of NMEA dates ==

Due to bad design of NMEA0183, the reporting protocol used by many GPS
sensors, the NMEA driver in NTPsec sometimes has to make an assumption
about what century it is.  Choice of a base-century hits the same
issues; so here the year derived from the BUILD_EPOCH is also used.  The
alternative - trusting the system clock to report the right century -
could produce very bad behavior near century boundaries, and also on
cold-start of systems without an RTC.
