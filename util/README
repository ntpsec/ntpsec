= README file for directory util/ =

This directory contains the sources for the various utility programs.
They are not installed by default. Not much documentation, alas.  Read
the header comments.

calc_tickadj::	Calculates "optimal" value for tick given ntp.drift file
		Tested: 20160226

hist.c::	This program can be used to calibrate the clock reading
		jitter of a particular CPU and operating system. It
		first tickles every element of an array, in order to
		force pages into memory, then repeatedly calls
		gettimeofday() and, finally, writes out the time
		values for later analysis. From this you can determine
		the jitter and if the clock ever runs backwards.
		To compile in the util directory, run waf configure and:
		gcc -I ../include/ -I ../build/ hist.c
		There is no documentation on how to interpret results.
		Tested: 20160226

kern.c:: 	Header comment from deep in the mists of past time says:
		"This program simulates a first-order, type-II
		phase-lock loop using actual code segments from
		modified kernel distributions for SunOS, Ultrix and
		OSF/1 kernels. These segments do not use any licensed
		code."  Anybody who has a clue *why* it is doing this
		and what it's supposed to be used for should explain
		it to us, please.

monitoring::	Directory containing perl scripts useful for monitoring
                operations

ntpdate::	Wrapper script to maintain compatibility. Maps options
		to ntpdig and calls it.
		Tested: 20160226

ntpsweep::	prints per host given in <file> the NTP stratum level, the
		clock offset in seconds, the daemon version, the operating
		system and the processor.
		Needs -I <directory above NTP/Util.pm>
		May not work on today's Internet, because servers do not
		wish to be interrogated.
		Tested: 20160228

ntptrap::	An ancient perl script to log ntp mode 6 trap messages.
		Retained only so it can be translated and updated; it's
		almost certainly not useful as is. It sends a set_trap
		request to each server given and dumps the trap messages
		received. It handles refresh of set_trap. Currently it
		handles only NTP V2, however the NTP V3 servers
		also accept v2 requests. It will not interpret v3 system and
		peer statuses correctly.

ntpver::	Simple script using ntpq to print out the suite version.
		Tested: 20160226

plot_summary::	Plot summaries generated by summary script.

sht.c::		Test program for shared memory refclock.

stats::		directory containing awk and shell scripts useful for
		maintaining statistics summaries of clockstats, loopstats
		and peerstats files

summary::	Generate summary files out of stat files produced by NTP
                daemon.
