= README file for directory util/ =

This directory contains the sources for the various utility programs.
They are not installed by default. Not much documentation, alas.  Read
the header comments.

calc_tickadj::	Calculates "optimal" value for tick given ntp.drift file

audio-pcm.c::	Probe the capabilities of your sound card.  Assumes the
		SADA (Sun Audio Driver) interface from
		SunOS/Solaris/OpenSolaris, also implemented by *BSD
		and in the old OSS Linux sound layer.

bumpclock.c::	This is a simple program to bump the system clock so
		you can see how ntpd and your OS respond.  The single
		argument is the time-to-bump in microseconds.  The
		default is 100000.  Stand-alone compile.

hist.c::	This program can be used to calibrate the clock reading
		jitter of a particular CPU and operating system. It
		first tickles every element of an array, in order to
		force pages into memory, then repeatedly calls
		gettimeofday() and, finally, writes out the time
		values for later analysis. From this you can determine
		the jitter and if the clock ever runs backwards.

kern.c:: 	Header comment from deep in the mists of past time says:
		"This program simulates a first-order, type-II
		phase-lock loop using actual code segments from
		modified kernel distributions for SunOS, Ultrix and
		OSF/1 kernels. These segments do not use any licensed
		code."  Anybody who has a clue *why* it is doing this
		and what it's supposed to be used for should explain
		it to us, please.

monitoring::	Directory containing perl scripts useful for monitoring
                operations

ntpsweep::	prints per host given in <file> the NTP stratum level, the
		clock offset in seconds, the daemon version, the operating
		system and the processor.

ntpver::	Simple script using ntpq to print out the suite version.

plot_summary::	Plot summaries generated by summary script.

propdelay.c::	Computes high frequency propagation delays, given the
		longitude and latitude of the transmitter and receiver.  Use
		this for WWV/H and CHU.  Don't use it for WWVB (the computation
		is easier for that).

sht.c::		Test program for shared memory refclock.

stats::		directory containing awk and shell scripts useful for
		maintaining statistics summaries of clockstats, loopstats
		and peerstats files

summary::	Generate summary files out of stat files produced by NTP
                daemon.

tg2.c::		A tone generator; makes audio signals that emulate WWV/H or
		IRIG. Should run on Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD and Linux provised
		the platform supports the SADA API.  Read the source for the fine
		print.  Has a help option available via -h.
