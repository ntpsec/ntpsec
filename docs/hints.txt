This is an index for a set of troubleshooting notes contained in
individual text files in the `./hints` directory. They were supplied by
various volunteers in the form of mail messages, patches or just plain
word of mouth. Each note applies to a specific computer and operating
system and gives information found useful in setting up the NTP
distribution or site configuration. The notes are very informal and
subject to errors; no attempt has been made to verify the accuracy of
the information contained in them.

Additions or corrections to this list or the information contained in
the notes is solicited. The most useful submissions include the name of
the computer manufacturer (and model numbers where appropriate),
operating system (specific version(s) where appropriate), problem
description, problem solution and submitter's name and electric address.
If the submitter is willing to continue debate on the problem, please so
advise. See the link:hints/[directory listing].
