Figure 1. Typical Symmetric Key File

Figure 1 shows a typical symmetric keys file used by the reference
implementation. Each line of the file contains three fields, first
keyno an integer between 1 and 65535, inclusive, representing the
key identifier used in the `server` configuration commands. Next
is the key type for the message digest algorithm, which can be any
message digest algorithm supported by the OpenSSL library.

For details, see {ntpkeysman}.

+ntpkeygen+ just makes a sample file with good random keys.  You can
edit it by hand to change the keyno or keytype and/or copy lines to
other key files.
