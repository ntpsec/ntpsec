== Synopsis ==

["literal",subs="normal"]
Address: 127.127.34._u_
Reference ID: WWVB
Driver ID: ULINK
Serial Port: /dev/wwvbu; 9600 bps, 8-bits, no parity
Features: (none)

== Description ==

This driver supports the Ultralink Model 325 (replacement for Model 320)
RS-232 powered WWVB receiver. PDF specs available on
http://www.ulio.com/. This driver also supports the Model 320,
330,331,332 decoders in both polled or continous time code mode. Leap
second and quality are supported. Most of this code is originally from
refclock_wwvb.c (now refclock_spectracom.c) with thanks. Any mistakes
are mine. Any improvements are welcome.

== Model 325 timecode format ==

`<cr><lf>RQ_1C00LYYYY+DDDUTCS_HH:MM:SSL+5`

R = Signal readability indicator, ranging from R1 to R5 Q R1 is unreadable, R5 is best reception +
_ = Space +
1 = prev. received data bit, values: 0, 1 ,M or ? unknown C = Signal
reception from \(C)olorado or (H)awaii 0 = Hours since last WWVB time and flag code update, values 0 00 to 99 (hopefully always 00) +
L =  HEX A5 if receiver is locked to WWVB, Space if not +
YYYY = Year from 2000 to 2099 +
 + = `+' if current year is a leap year, else ` ' +
DDD = current day in the year form 1 to 365/366 +
UTC = timezone (always UTC) +
S = Daylight savings indicator, (S)TD, (D)ST, (O) transition into DST, (O) transition into DST, (I) transition out of DST +
_ = Space +
HH = UTC hour 0 to 23 +
: = Time delimiter, `:' if synced, Space if not +
MM = Minutes of current hour from 0 to 59 +
: = Time delimiter, `:' if synced, Space if not +
SS = Seconds of current minute from 0 to 59 +
mm = 10's milliseconds of the current second from 00 to 99 +
L = Leap second pending at end of month, (I)nsert, (D)elete or Space +
+5 = UT1 correction, +/- .1 sec increments

Note that Model 325 reports a very similar output like Model 33X series.
The driver for this clock is similar to Model 33X behavior. On a
unmodified new ULM325 clock, the polling flag (flag1 =1) needs to be
set.

== Model 320 timecode format ==

`<cr><lf>SQRYYYYDDD+HH:MM:SS.mmLT<cr>`

S = 'S' -- sync'd in last hour, '0'-'9' - hours x 10 since last update, else `?' +
Q = Number of correlating time-frames, from 0 to 5 +
R = 'R' -- reception in progress,'N' -- Noisy reception, ' ' -- standby +
YYYY = year from 1990 to 2089 +
DDD = current day from 1 to 366 + = `+' if current year is a leap year, else ` ' +
HH = UTC hour 0 to 23 +
MM = Minutes of current hour from 0 to 59 +
SS = Seconds of current minute from 0 to 59 +
L = Leap second pending at end of month == `I' = insert, `D'=delete +
T = DST <-> STD transition indicators +

Note that this driver does not do anything with the T flag. The M320
also has a 'U' command which returns UT1 correction information. It is
not used in this driver.

== Model 33x timecode format ==

`S9+D 00 YYYY+DDDUTCS HH:MM:SSl+5`

S = sync indicator S insync N not in sync the sync flag is WWVB decoder
sync nothing to do with time being correct

9+ = signal level 0 thru 9+ If over 9 indicated as 9 +
D = data bit (fun to watch but useless ;-) space +
00 = hours since last GOOD WWVB frame sync space +
YYYY = current year + = leap year indicator +
DDD = day of year +
UTC = timezone (always UTC) +
S = daylight savings indicator space +
HH = hours : = This is the REAL in sync indicator (: = insync) +
MM = minutes : = : = in sync ? = NOT in sync +
SS = seconds +
L = leap second flag
+5 = UT1 correction (sign + digit ))

This driver ignores UT1 correction, DST indicator,Leap year and signal
level.

== Fudge factors ==

flag1 polling enable (1=poll 0=no poll)
