[[introduction]]
== Introduction ==

Because NTP is a widely-used an well-established service, people
who write tools for system administrators frequently have
features and plugins designed to help you work with it. This
page collects some references that may be useful.

[[wireshark]]
== Wireshark ==

The https://www.wireshark.org/[Wireshark] protocol analyzer has
support for displaying NTP packets with the fields broken out
and interpreted.

[[nagios]]
== Nagios ==

The https://www.nagios.org/[Nagios] monitoring suite has native
support for querying NTP servers.  The 'check_ntp_peer' and
'check_ntp_time' programs may be of particular interest.

[[netdata]]
== Netdata ==

The https://github.com/firehol/netdata/wiki[Netdata] monitoring
solution has native support for realtime monitoring of ntpd,
among a vast number of other system metrics.
