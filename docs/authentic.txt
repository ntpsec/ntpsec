== Autokey is disabled ==

The Autokey feature described here and elsewhere cannot presently
be enabled in production builds of {project-shortname}.  It has a history
of instability, and of interoperability problems, and has even been
exploited as an attack vector against time servers and clients.  These
problems are not known to have affected symmetric-key authentication,
only Autokey itself.

The maintainers have not been able to identify anyone using Autokey
successfully in production. If you are such a person, please inform
us.  It is still possible to enable Autokey with a relatively trivial
custom tweak to the build system.

Autokey will remain disabled by default until the maintainers have
confidence that its deficiencies have been repaired. We would welcome
any assistance in that repair.

== Introduction ==

Authentication support allows the NTP client to verify that the server
is in fact known and trusted and not an intruder intending
accidentally or on purpose to masquerade as that server.  NTP performs
authentication via the RSA Message Digest 5 (MD5) algorithm using a
private key, commonly called keyed-MD5. Either algorithm computes a
message digest, or one-way hash, which can be used to verify the
server has the correct private key and key identifier.

A detailed discussion of the NTP multi-layer security model and
vulnerability analysis is in the white paper
{millshome}security.html[NTP Security Analysis].

//NTPv4 retains the NTPv3 scheme, properly described as symmetric key
//cryptography and, in addition, provides a new Autokey scheme based on
//public key cryptography. Public key cryptography is generally considered
//more secure than symmetric key cryptography, since the security is based
//on a private value which is generated by each server and never revealed.
//With Autokey all key distribution and management functions involve only
//public values, which considerably simplifies key distribution and
//storage. Public key management is based on X.509 certificates, which can
//be provided by commercial services or produced by utility programs in
//the OpenSSL software library or the NTPv4 distribution.
//
//While the algorithms for symmetric key cryptography are included in the
//NTPv4 distribution, public key cryptography requires the OpenSSL
//software library to be installed before building the NTP distribution.
//Directions for doing that are on the "Building and Installing the
//Distribution page."

//"or +autokey+" should be appended to the next line when it works 
Authentication is configured separately for each association using the +key+
subcommand on the +peer+, +server+, +broadcast+ and +manycastclient+
configuration commands. The authentication options described below
specify the locations of the key files, if other than default, which
symmetric keys are trusted and the interval between various
operations, if other than default.

Authentication is always enabled, although ineffective if not configured
as described below. If a NTP packet arrives including a message
authentication code (MAC), it is accepted only if it passes all
cryptographic checks. The checks require correct key ID, key value and
message digest. If the packet has been modified in any way or replayed
by an intruder, it will fail one or more of these checks and be
discarded. Furthermore, the Autokey scheme requires a preliminary
protocol exchange to obtain the server certificate, verify its
credentials and initialize the protocol

The +auth+ flag controls whether new associations or remote
configuration commands require cryptographic authentication. This flag
can be set or reset by the +enable+ and +disable+ commands and also by
remote configuration commands sent by a {ntpqman} program
running in another machine. If this flag is enabled, which is the
default case, new broadcast client and symmetric passive associations
and remote configuration commands must be cryptographically
authenticated using either symmetric key or public key cryptography. If
this flag is disabled, these operations are effective even if not
cryptographic authenticated. It should be understood that operating with
theauthflag disabled invites a significant vulnerability where a rogue
hacker can masquerade as a falseticker and seriously disrupt system
timekeeping. It is important to note that this flag has no purpose other
than to allow or disallow a new association in response to new broadcast
and symmetric active messages and remote configuration commands and, in
particular, the flag has no effect on the authentication process
itself.

An attractive alternative where multicast support is available is
manycast mode, in which clients periodically troll for servers as
described in the 'Automatic NTP Configuration Options' page of the Web
documentation.  Either symmetric key or public key cryptographic
authentication can be used in this mode. The principle advantage of
manycast mode is that potential servers need not be configured in
advance, since the client finds them during regular operation, and the
configuration files for all clients can be identical.

The security model and protocol schemes for symmetric key
//and public key cryptography
are summarized below; further details are in the
briefings, papers and reports at the {project-fullname} page linked from
{project-website}.

[[symm]]
=== Symmetric-Key Cryptography ===

NTP allows any one of possibly 65,534 keys, each distinguished by a
32-bit key identifier, to authenticate an association. The servers and
clients involved must agree on the key and key identifier to
authenticate NTP packets. Keys and related information are specified
in a key file, usually called _{ntpkeys}_, which must be distributed
and stored using secure means beyond the scope of the NTP protocol
itself. Besides the keys used for ordinary NTP associations,
additional keys can be used as passwords for the {ntpqman} utility
program.

When {ntpdman} is first started, it reads the key file specified
in the keys configuration command and installs the keys in the key cache.
However, individual keys must be activated with the trusted command before
use. This allows, for instance, the installation of possibly several
batches of keys and then activating or deactivating each batch remotely
using {ntpqman}. This also provides a revocation capability
that can be used if a key becomes compromised. The controlkey command
selects the key used as the password for the {ntpqman} utility.

//=== Public Key Cryptography ===
//
//NTPv4 supports the Autokey protocol, which is based on public
//key cryptography. The Autokey Version 2 protocol described on the
//Autokey Protocol page verifies packet integrity using MD5 message
//digests and verifies the source with digital signatures and any of
//several digest/signature schemes. Optional identity schemes described on
//the Identity Schemes page and based on cryptographic challenge/response
//algorithms are also available. Using all of these schemes provides
//strong security against replay with or without modification, spoofing,
//masquerade and most forms of clogging attacks.
//
////FIXME: page reference may be invalid
//The Autokey protocol has several modes of operation corresponding to
//the various NTP modes supported. Most modes use a special cookie which
//can be computed independently by the client and server, but encrypted
//in transmission. All modes use in addition a variant of the S-KEY
//scheme, in which a pseudo-random key list is generated and used in
//reverse order. These schemes are described along with an executive
//summary, current status, briefing slides and reading list on the
//"Autonomous Authentication" page.
//
//The specific cryptographic environment used by Autokey servers and
//clients is determined by a set of files and soft links generated by the
//{keygenman} program. This includes a required host key
//file, required certificate file and optional sign key file, leapsecond
//file and identity scheme files. The digest/signature scheme is specified
//in the X.509 certificate along with the matching sign key. There are
//several schemes available in the OpenSSL software library, each
//identified by a specific string such as md5WithRSAEncryption, which
//stands for the MD5 message digest with RSA encryption scheme. The
//current NTP distribution supports all the schemes in the OpenSSL
//library, including those based on RSA and DSA digital signatures.
//
//NTP secure groups can be used to define cryptographic compartments and
//security hierarchies. It is important that every host in the group be
//able to construct a certificate trail to one or more trusted hosts in
//the same group. Each group host runs the Autokey protocol to obtain the
//certificates for all hosts along the trail to one or more trusted hosts.
//This requires the configuration file in all hosts to be engineered so
//that, even under anticipated failure conditions, the NTP subnet will
//form such that every group host can find a trail to at least one trusted
//host.
//
//=== Naming and Addressing ===
//
//It is important to note that Autokey does not use DNS to resolve
//addresses, since DNS can't be completely trusted until the name servers
//have synchronized clocks. The cryptographic name used by Autokey to bind
//the host identity credentials and cryptographic values must be
//independent of interface, network and any other naming convention. The
//name appears in the host certificate in either or both the subject and
//issuer fields, so protection against DNS compromise is essential.
//
//By convention, the name of an Autokey host is the name returned by the
//Unix gethostname(2) system call or equivalent in other systems. By the
//system design model, there are no provisions to allow alternate names or
//aliases. However, this is not to say that DNS aliases, different names
//for each interface, etc., are constrained in any way.
//
//It is also important to note that Autokey verifies authenticity using
//the host name, network address and public keys, all of which are bound
//together by the protocol specifically to deflect masquerade attacks. For
//this reason Autokey includes the source and destinatino IP addresses in
//message digest computations and so the same addresses must be available
//at both the server and client. For this reason operation with network
//address translation schemes is not possible. This reflects the intended
//robust security model where government and corporate NTP servers are
//operated outside firewall perimeters.

[[operation]]
== Operation ==

A specific combination of authentication scheme (none, symmetric key,
public key) and identity scheme is called a cryptotype, although not all
combinations are compatible. There may be management configurations
where the clients, servers and peers may not all support the same
cryptotypes. A secure NTP subnet can be configured in many ways while
keeping in mind the principles explained above and in this section. Note
however that some cryptotype combinations may successfully interoperate
with each other, but may not represent good security practice.

The cryptotype of an association is determined at the time of
mobilization, either at configuration time or some time later when a
message of appropriate cryptotype arrives. When mobilized by a +server+
or +peer+ configuration command and no +key+ or +autokey+ subcommands
are present, the association is not authenticated; if the +key+
subcommand is present, the association is authenticated using the
symmetric key ID specified.

//If the +autokey+ subcommand is present, the
//association is authenticated using Autokey.
//
//When multiple identity schemes are supported in the Autokey protocol,
//the first message exchange determines which one is used. The client
//request message contains bits corresponding to which schemes it has
//available. The server response message contains bits corresponding to
//which schemes it has available. Both server and client match the
//received bits with their own and select a common scheme.

Following the principle that time is a public value, a server responds
to any client packet that matches its cryptotype capabilities. Thus, a
server receiving an unauthenticated packet will respond with an
unauthenticated packet, while the same server receiving a packet of a
cryptotype it supports will respond with packets of that cryptotype.
However, unconfigured broadcast or manycast client associations or
symmetric passive associations will not be mobilized unless the server
supports a cryptotype compatible with the first packet received. By
default, unauthenticated associations will not be mobilized unless
overridden in a decidedly dangerous way.

Some examples may help to reduce confusion. Client Alice has no specific
cryptotype selected. Server Bob has a symmetric key file.
//and minimal Autokey files.
Alice's unauthenticated messages arrive at Bob,
who replies with unauthenticated messages. Cathy has a copy of Bob's
symmetric key file and has selected key ID 4 in messages to Bob. Bob
verifies the message with his key ID 4. If it's the same key and the
message is verified, Bob sends Cathy a reply authenticated with that
key. If verification fails, Bob sends Cathy a thing called a crypto-NAK,
which tells her something broke. She can see the evidence using the
{ntpqman} program.

//Denise has rolled her own host key and certificate. She also uses one of
//the identity schemes as Bob. She sends the first Autokey message to Bob
//and they both dance the protocol authentication and identity steps. If
//all comes out okay, Denise and Bob continue as described above.

It should be clear from the above that Bob can support all the girls at
the same time, as long as he has compatible authentication and identity
credentials. Now, Bob can act just like the girls in his own choice of
servers; he can run multiple configured associations with multiple
different servers (or the same server, although that might not be
useful). But, wise security policy might preclude some cryptotype
combinations; for instance, running an identity scheme with one server
and no authentication with another might not be wise.

[[keys]]
== Key Management ==

The cryptographic values used by the Autokey protocol are incorporated
as a set of files generated by the {keygenman} utility
program, including symmetric key, host key and public certificate files,
as well as sign key, identity parameters and leapseconds files.
Alternatively, host and sign keys and certificate files can be generated
by the OpenSSL utilities and certificates can be imported from public
certificate authorities. Note that symmetric keys are necessary for the
{ntpqman} utility program. The remaining files are necessary only for
the Autokey protocol.

Certificates imported from OpenSSL or public certificate authorities
have certain limitations. The certificate should be in ASN.1 syntax,
X.509 Version 3 format and encoded in PEM, which is the same format used
by OpenSSL. The overall length of the certificate encoded in ASN.1 must
not exceed 1024 bytes. The subject distinguished name field (CN) is the
fully qualified name of the host on which it is used; the remaining
subject fields are ignored. The certificate extension fields must not
contain either a subject key identifier or a issuer key identifier
field; however, an extended key usage field for a trusted host must
contain the value _trustRoot_;. Other extension fields are ignored.

[[algorithms]]
== Algorithms ==

The NTP standards include symmetric (private-key) authentication using
the RSA Message Digest 5 (MD5) algorithm commonly ,called
keyed-MD5. This algorithm computes a message digest or one-way hash
which can be used to verify the client has the same message digest as
the server. The MD5 message digest algorithm is included in the
distribution, so without further cryptographic support, the
distribution can be freely exported.

If the OpenSSL cryptographic library is installed prior to building the
distribution, all message digest algorithms included in the library may
be used, including SHA and SHA1. However, if conformance to FIPS 140-2
is required, only a limited subset of these algorithms can be used. This
library is available from http://www.openssl.org and can be installed
using the procedures outlined in the link:build.html[Building and
Installing the Distribution] page. Once installed, the configure and
build process automatically detects the library and links the library
routines required.

//In addition to the symmetric key algorithms, this distribution includes
//support for the Autokey public key algorithms and protocol specified in
//RFC-5906 "Network Time Protocol Version 4: Autokey Specification". This
//support is available only if the OpenSSL library has been installed and
//the +--enable-autokey+ option is used when the distribution is built.
//
//Public key cryptography is generally considered more secure than
//symmetric key cryptography, since the security is based on private and
//public values which are generated by each participant and where the
//private value is never revealed. Autokey uses X.509 public certificates,
//which can be produced by commercial services, the OpenSSL application
//program, or the link:keygen.html[+{ntpkeygen}+] utility program in the
//NTP software distribution.

Note that according to US law, NTP binaries including OpenSSL library
components, including the OpenSSL library itself, cannot be exported
outside the US without license from the US Department of Commerce.
(However, these restrictions have been considerably relaxed since 1996.)
Builders outside the US are advised to obtain the OpenSSL library
directly from OpenSSL, which is outside the US, and build outside the
US.

Authentication is configured separately for each association using the
+key+ or +autokey+ option of the +server+ configuration command, as
described in the link:confopt.html[Server Options] page. The
link:keygen.html[{ntpkeygen}] page describes the files required for the
various authentication schemes. Further details are in the briefings,
papers and reports at the {project-shortname} project page linked from
{project-weblink}.

By default, the client sends non-authenticated packets and the server
responds with non-authenticated packets. If the client sends
authenticated packets, the server responds with authenticated packets if
correct, or a crypto-NAK packet if not.. In the case of unsolicited
packets which might consume significant resources, such as broadcast or
symmetric mode packets, authentication is required, unless overridden
by a +disable auth+ command. In the current climate of targeted
broadcast or "letterbomb" attacks, defeating this requirement would be
decidedly dangerous. In any case, the +notrust +flag, described on the
link:authopt.html[Access Control Options] page, can be used to disable
access to all but correctly authenticated clients..

[[formats]]
== Data Formats ==

The NTPv4 specification (RFC-5905) allows any one of possibly 65,534
message digest keys (excluding zero), each distinguished by a 32-bit key
ID, to authenticate an association. The servers and clients involved
must agree on the key ID, key type and key to authenticate NTP packets.

The message digest is a cryptographic hash computed by an algorithm such
as MD5 or SHA. When authentication is specified, a message
authentication code (MAC) is appended to the NTP packet header. The MAC
consists of a 32-bit key identifier (key ID) followed by a 128- or
160-bit message digest. The algorithm computes the digest as the hash of
a 128- or 160- bit message digest key concatenated with the NTP packet
header fields with the exception of the MAC. On transmit, the message
digest is computed and inserted in the MAC. On receive, the message
digest is computed and compared with the MAC. The packet is accepted
only if the two MACs are identical. If a discrepancy is found by the
client, the client ignores the packet, but raises an alarm. If this
happens at the server, the server returns a special message called a
_crypto-NAK_. Since the crypto-NAK is protected by the loopback test, an
intruder cannot disrupt the protocol by sending a bogus crypto-NAK.

Keys and related information are specified in a keys file, which must be
distributed and stored using secure means beyond the scope of the NTP
protocol itself. Besides the keys used for ordinary NTP associations,
additional keys can be used as passwords for the +{ntpq}+
utility program. Ordinarily, the +{ntpkeys}+ file is generated by the
+{ntpkeygen}+ program, but it can be constructed and edited using an
ordinary text editor.

Each line of the keys file consists of three fields: a key ID in the
range 1 to 65,534, inclusive, a key type, and a message digest key
consisting of a printable ASCII string less than 40 characters, or a
40-character hex digit string. If the OpenSSL library is installed, the
key type can be any message digest algorithm supported by the library.
If the OpenSSL library is not installed, the only permitted key type is
MD5.

.Figure 1. Typical Symmetric Key File
image:pic/sx5.gif["Typical Symmetric Key File",align="center"]


Figure 1 shows a typical keys file used by the reference implementation
when the OpenSSL library is installed. In this figure, for key IDs in he
range 1-10, the key is interpreted as a printable ASCII string. For key
IDs in the range 11-20, the key is a 40-character hex digit string. The
key is truncated or zero-filled internally to either 128 or 160 bits,
depending on the key type. The line can be edited later or new lines can
be added to change any field. The key can be change to a password, such
as +2late4Me+ for key ID 10. Note that two or more keys files can be
combined in any order as long as the key IDs are distinct.

When +{ntpd}+ is started, it reads the keys file specified by the +keys+
command and installs the keys in the key cache. However, individual keys
must be activated with the +trustedkey+ configuration command before
use. This allows, for instance, the installation of possibly several
batches of keys and then activating a key remotely using +{ntpq}+.
The +controlkey+ command selects the key ID used as the password
for the +{ntpq}+ utility.

//[[windows]]
//== Microsoft Windows Authentication ==
//
//In addition to the above means, +{ntpd}+ supports Microsoft Windows
//MS-SNTP authentication using Active Directory services. This support was
//contributed by the Samba Team and is still in development. It is enabled
//using the +mssntp+ flag of the +restrict+ command described on the
//link:accopt.html#restrict[Access Control Options] page. [red]#Note: Potential
//users should be aware that these services involve a TCP connection to
//another process that could potentially block, denying services to other
//users. Therefore, this flag should be used only for a dedicated server
//with no clients other than MS-SNTP.
