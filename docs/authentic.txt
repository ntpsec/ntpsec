[[noauto]]
== Autokey is disabled ==

The Autokey feature described here and elsewhere is not presently
enabled in production builds of {project-shortname}.  It has a history
of instability, and of interoperability problems, and has even been
exploited as an attack vector against time servers and clients.  These
problems are not known to have affected symmetric-key authentication,
only Autokey itself.

The maintainers have not been able to identify anyone using Autokey
successfully in production. If you are such a person, please inform
us.  It is still possible to enable Autokey with a relatively trivial
tweak to the build system.

Autokey will remain disabled by default until the maintainers have
confidence that its deficiencies have been repaired. We would welcome
any assistance in that repair.


[[auth]]
== Introduction ==

This page describes the various cryptographic authentication provisions
in NTPv4. Authentication support allows the NTP client to verify that
servers are in fact known and trusted and not intruders intending
accidentally or intentionally to masquerade as a legitimate server. A
detailed discussion of the NTP multi-layer security model and
vulnerability analysis is in the white paper
http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/security.html[NTP Security Analysis].

The NTPv3 specification (RFC-1305) defined an authentication scheme
properly described as _symmetric key cryptography_. It used the Data
Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm operating in cipher-block chaining
(CBC) mode. Subsequently, this algorithm was replaced by the RSA Message
Digest 5 (MD5) algorithm commonly called keyed-MD5. Either algorithm
computes a message digest or one-way hash which can be used to verify
the client has the same message digest as the server. The MD5 message
digest algorithm is included in the distribution, so without further
cryptographic support, the distribution can be freely exported.

If the OpenSSL cryptographic library is installed prior to building the
distribution, all message digest algorithms included in the library may
be used, including SHA and SHA1. However, if conformance to FIPS 140-2
is required, only a limited subset of these algorithms can be used. This
library is available from http://www.openssl.org and can be installed
using the procedures outlined in the link:build.html[Building and
Installing the Distribution] page. Once installed, the configure and
build process automatically detects the library and links the library
routines required.

In addition to the symmetric key algorithms, this distribution includes
support for the Autokey public key algorithms and protocol specified in
RFC-5906 "Network Time Protocol Version 4: Autokey Specification". This
support is available only if the OpenSSL library has been installed and
the `--enable-autokey` option is used when the distribution is built.

Public key cryptography is generally considered more secure than
symmetric key cryptography, since the security is based on private and
public values which are generated by each participant and where the
private value is never revealed. Autokey uses X.509 public certificates,
which can be produced by commercial services, the OpenSSL application
program, or the link:keygen.html[`ntp-keygen`] utility program in the
NTP software distribution.

Note that according to US law, NTP binaries including OpenSSL library
components, including the OpenSSL library itself, cannot be exported
outside the US without license from the US Department of Commerce.
Builders outside the US are advised to obtain the OpenSSL library
directly from OpenSSL, which is outside the US, and build outside the
US.

Authentication is configured separately for each association using the
`key` or `autokey` option of the `server` configuration command, as
described in the link:confopt.html[Server Options] page. The
link:keygen.html[ntp-keygen] page describes the files required for the
various authentication schemes. Further details are in the briefings,
papers and reports at the {project-shortname} project page linked from
{project-weblink}.

By default, the client sends non-authenticated packets and the server
responds with non-authenticated packets. If the client sends
authenticated packets, the server responds with authenticated packets if
correct, or a crypto-NAK packet if not.. In the case of unsolicited
packets which might consume significant resources, such as broadcast or
symmetric mode packets, , authentication is required, unless overridden
by a `disable auth` command. In the current climate of targeted
broadcast or "letterbomb" attacks, defeating this requirement would be
decidedly dangerous. In any case, the `notrust `flag, described on the
link:authopt.html[Access Control Options] page, can be used to disable
access to all but correctly authenticated clients..

[[symm]]
== Symmetric Key Cryptography ==

The original NTPv3 specification (RFC-1305), as well as the current
NTPv4 specification (RFC-5905), allows any one of possibly 65,534
message digest keys (excluding zero), each distinguished by a 32-bit key
ID, to authenticate an association. The servers and clients involved
must agree on the key ID, key type and key to authenticate NTP packets.

The message digest is a cryptographic hash computed by an algorithm such
as MD5 or SHA. When authentication is specified, a message
authentication code (MAC) is appended to the NTP packet header. The MAC
consists of a 32-bit key identifier (key ID) followed by a 128- or
160-bit message digest. The algorithm computes the digest as the hash of
a 128- or 160- bit message digest key concatenated with the NTP packet
header fields with the exception of the MAC. On transmit, the message
digest is computed and inserted in the MAC. On receive, the message
digest is computed and compared with the MAC. The packet is accepted
only if the two MACs are identical. If a discrepancy is found by the
client, the client ignores the packet, but raises an alarm. If this
happens at the server, the server returns a special message called a
_crypto-NAK_. Since the crypto-NAK is protected by the loopback test, an
intruder cannot disrupt the protocol by sending a bogus crypto-NAK.

Keys and related information are specified in a keys file, which must be
distributed and stored using secure means beyond the scope of the NTP
protocol itself. Besides the keys used for ordinary NTP associations,
additional keys can be used as passwords for the `ntpq`
utility program. Ordinarily, the `ntp.keys` file is generated by the
`ntp-keygen` program, but it can be constructed and edited using an
ordinary text editor.

Each line of the keys file consists of three fields: a key ID in the
range 1 to 65,534, inclusive, a key type, and a message digest key
consisting of a printable ASCII string less than 40 characters, or a
40-character hex digit string. If the OpenSSL library is installed, the
key type can be any message digest algorithm supported by the library.
If the OpenSSL library is not installed, the only permitted key type is
MD5.

.Figure 1. Typical Symmetric Key File
image:pic/sx5.gif["Typical Symmetric Key File",align="center"]


Figure 1 shows a typical keys file used by the reference implementation
when the OpenSSL library is installed. In this figure, for key IDs in he
range 1-10, the key is interpreted as a printable ASCII string. For key
IDs in the range 11-20, the key is a 40-character hex digit string. The
key is truncated or zero-filled internally to either 128 or 160 bits,
depending on the key type. The line can be edited later or new lines can
be added to change any field. The key can be change to a password, such
as `2late4Me` for key ID 10. Note that two or more keys files can be
combined in any order as long as the key IDs are distinct.

When `ntpd` is started, it reads the keys file specified by the `keys`
command and installs the keys in the key cache. However, individual keys
must be activated with the `trustedkey` configuration command before
use. This allows, for instance, the installation of possibly several
batches of keys and then activating a key remotely using `ntpq`.
The `controlkey` command selects the key ID used as the password
for the `ntpq` utility.

[[windows]]
== Microsoft Windows Authentication ==

In addition to the above means, `ntpd` supports Microsoft Windows
MS-SNTP authentication using Active Directory services. This support was
contributed by the Samba Team and is still in development. It is enabled
using the `mssntp` flag of the `restrict` command described on the
link:accopt.html#restrict[Access Control Options] page. [red]#Note: Potential
users should be aware that these services involve a TCP connection to
another process that could potentially block, denying services to other
users. Therefore, this flag should be used only for a dedicated server
with no clients other than MS-SNTP.
