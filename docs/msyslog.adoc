You have come here because you found a cryptic message in the system
log. This page by no means lists all messages that might be found, since
new ones come and old ones go. Generally, however, the most common ones
will be found here. They are listed by program module and log severity
code in bold: *+LOG_ERR+*, *+LOG_NOTICE+* and *+LOG_INFO+*.

Most of the time *+LOG_ERR+* messages are fatal, but often +ntpd+ limps
onward in the hopes of discovering more errors. The *+LOG_NOTICE+*
messages usually mean the time has changed or some other condition that
probably should be noticed. The *+LOG_INFO+* messages usually say
something about the system operations, but do not affect the time.

In the following a \'?' character stands for text in the message. The
meaning should be clear from context.

== Protocol Module ==

=== LOG_ERR ===

+buffer overflow ?+::
  Fatal error. An input packet is too long for processing.

=== LOG_NOTICE ===

+no reply; clock not set+::
  No servers have been found. The server(s) and/or
  network may be down. Standard debugging procedures apply.

=== LOG_INFO ===

+proto_config: illegal item ?, value ?+::
  Program error. Bugs can be reported link:bugs.html[here].
+receive: server server maximum rate exceeded+::
  A kiss-o'death packet has been received. The transmit rate is
  automatically reduced.
+pps sync enabled+::
  The PPS signal has been detected and enabled.
+transmit: encryption key ? not found+::
  The encryption key is not defined or not trusted.
+precision = ? usec+::
  This reports the precision measured for this machine.
+using 10ms tick adjustments+::
  Gotcha for some machines with dirty rotten clock hardware.
+no servers reachable+::
  The system clock is running on internal batteries. The server(s)
  and/or network may be down.

== Clock Discipline Module ==

=== LOG_ERR ===
--
+time correction of ? seconds exceeds sanity limit (?); set clock manually to the correct UTC time+. ::
   Fatal error. Better do what it says, then restart the daemon. Be advised
   NTP and Unix know nothing about local time zones. The clock must be set
   to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Believe it; by international
   agreement abbreviations are in French and descriptions are in English.

+sigaction() fails to save SIGSYS trap: ?+::
+sigaction() fails to restore SIGSYS trap: ?+::
    Program error. Bugs can be reported link:bugs.html[here].::
--

=== LOG_NOTICE ===

+frequency error ? exceeds tolerance 500 PPM+::
  The hardware clock frequency error exceeds the rate the kernel can
  correct. This could be a hardware or a kernel problem.
+time slew ? s+::
  The time error exceeds the step threshold and is being slewed to the
  correct time. You may have to wait a very long time.
+time reset ? s+::
  The time error exceeds the step threshold and has been reset to the
  correct time. Computer scientists don't like this, but they can set
  the +ntpd -x+ option and wait forever.
+kernel time sync disabled ?+::
  The kernel reports an error. See the codes in the +timex.h+ file.
+pps sync disabled+::
  The PPS signal has died, probably due to a dead radio, broken wire or
  loose connector.

=== LOG_INFO ===

+kernel time sync status ?+::
  For information only. See the codes in the +timex.h+ file.
