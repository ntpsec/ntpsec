== Synopsis ==

+ntpmon+

== Description ==

This program is a real-time status monitor for NTP.  It presents the
same information as the 'peers' and 'mrulist' commands of {ntpqman},
but using a split-window display that also includes a status summary
bar, and updates at intervals guaranteed to show status changes as
soon as they occur.

(Specifically, the display begins updating once per second and
adjusts itself to poll at twice the frequency of the shortest
polling interval reported in the last peers response.)
