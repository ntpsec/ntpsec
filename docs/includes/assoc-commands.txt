In these commands, an _address_ can be any of (a) an IPV4 address in
a.b.c.d format, (b) an IPV6 address in [a:b:c:d:e:f:g] format, (c) a
link-local IPV6 address with an interface specified in
[a:b:c:d:e:f:g]%device format, or (d) a DNS hostname.

+unpeer+ ['address' | 'associd']::
  These six commands specify the time server name or address to be used
  and the mode in which to operate. The _address_ can be either a DNS
  name or an IP address in dotted-quad notation.

[[pool]]
+pool+::
  For server addresses, this command mobilizes a persistent client
  mode association with a number of remote servers. In this mode the
  local clock can synchronized to the remote server, but the remote
  server can never be synchronized to the local clock.

[[server]]
+server+::
  For server addresses, this command mobilizes a persistent client
  mode association with the specified remote server or local radio
  clock. In this mode the local clock can synchronized to the remote
  server, but the remote server can never be synchronized to the local
  clock.

[[peer]]
+peer+::
  NTP peer mode has been removed for security reasons.  peer is now just
  an alias for the server keyword.  See above.

[[broadcast]]
+broadcast+::
  Note: This mode of server operation is deprecated, as broadcast
  associations cannot be secured.  Broadcast-client mode has been
  completely removed.
+
For broadcast addresses (only), this command mobilizes a persistent
broadcast mode association. Multiple commands can be used to specify
multiple local broadcast interfaces (subnets) In broadcast mode the
local server sends periodic broadcast messages to a client population
at the _address_ specified, which is usually the broadcast address on
(one of) the local network(s).

[[unpeer]]
+unpeer+::
  This command removes a previously configured association. An address
  or association ID can be used to identify the association. Either an
  IP address or DNS name can be used. This command is most useful when
  supplied via +ntpq+ runtime configuration commands +config+ and
  +config-from-file+.
