== Synopsis ==

+ntpsnmpd+ [+-ndDV+] [ntp host]

== Description ==

+ntpsnmpd+ is an AgentX Simple Network Management Protocol sub-agent.

It functions as a bridge between the Mode 6 protocol used for Network
Time Protocol monitoring, and an SNMP master agent. The user must have
running NTP and SNMP daemons for ntpsnmpd to work.

== Options ==

+-n+, +--nofork+::
  Do not fork
+-x+, +--master-addr+::
  Specify address for connecting to the master agent
+-d+, +--debug+::
  Increase debugging level by 1.
+-D+ num, +--set-debug-level+=num::
  The debug level is set to the following integer argument.
+-l+ filename, +--logfile+=filename::
  Log debugging output to the specified file.
+-h+, +--help+::
  Print a usage message summarizing options end exit.
+-V+, +--version+::
  Print the version string and exit.

== Known Limitations ==

This is a prototype. Parts of the AgentX standard are not yet implemented.

== Known Deviations from the MIB ==

The ntpEntStatusEntityUptime OID specifies a bizzare time formant. This
does not match what the SNMP tools expect to see from a TimeTicks variable.
Instead the daemon returns a normal TimeTicks value.

The ntpEntNotifConfigChanged trap is left unimplemented. This is because
there currently is no way to implement what it wants, and it demands alerts
regarding changes that are not part of NTPs jurisdiction.

The ntpEntTimeResolution OID currently uses data from the sys_fuzz variable
as the base for it's calculations. It is by no means certain that this is
the correct choice, and the returned data should be taken with scepticism.

The ntpEntStatPktModeTable is unimplemented due to not currently having a
data source.
