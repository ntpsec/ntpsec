== SYNOPSIS ==
[verse]
{ntpviz} [-d statsdir] [-g] [-n name] [-p period] [-s starttime]
         [--clock-offset | --clock-jitter | --clock-stability]
         [--peer-offsets hosts | --all-peer-offsets]
         [--peer-jitters hosts | --all-peer-jitters]

== DESCRIPTION ==

This utility analyzes files in an NTP log directory and generates
statistical plots from them.  It can report either PNG images or
the GNUPLOT programs to generate them to standard output.

The most basic option is -d, which specifies a logfile directory to
examine; the default is /var/log/ntpstats.

The -n option allows you to set the sitename shown in the plot title.
The default is the basename of the log directory.

The -s and -p options allow you to set the time window to be reported
on. With -s you set the start time as an ISO8601-style timestamp
- yyyy-mmm-ddThh:mm:ss. With -p you set the default in days.  The default
is for the period to be 7 days and the start time to be set so that adding
the period just reaches the last logfile entry.

The --clock-offset, --clock-jitter, and --clock-stability options
chose what graph is generated; choose only one.  By default, the
GNUPLOT for the graph is reported; with -g you get the rendered PNG.

The following plots are available:

--local-offset::
   Clock time and clock frequency offsets from the loop statistics
   (fields 3 and 4).

--local-jitter::
   Clock time-jitter plot from the loop statistics (field 5).

--local-stability::
   RMS frequency-jitter plot from the loop statistics (field 6).
   This is deviation from a root-mean-square extrapolation of the
   moving average of past frequency readings.

--peer-offsets=host1[,host2...]::
   Peer offset from local clock time from peerstats (field 4). A
   comma-separated list of peer names must follow. It is a fatal
   error for any of these names not to appear in peerstats.

--all-peer-offsets::
   Report all peer offsets.  This is only a different
   option name from --peer-offsets only because of a minor limitation
   in the Python standard library.

--peer-jitter=host1[,host2...]::
   Peer jitter from local clock time, from peerstats (field 7)
   A comma-separated list of peer names must follow. It is a fatal
   error for any of these names not to appear in peerstats.

--all-peer-jitters::
   Report all peer jitters.  This is only a different option name from
   --peer-offsets only because of a limitation in the Python
   standard library.

--peer-rtt=host::
   Show offset plus or minus round-trip-time (rtt) of a specified
   peer. This graph combines fields 4 and 5 of loopstats.

The code includes various sanity checks and will bail out with a message to
standard error on, for example, missing logfile data required for a plot.

== REQUIREMENTS ==

Python and GNUPLOT.  The plots will look better with the 'liberation'
font package installed.

== AUTHORS ==

Eric S. Raymond  and Daniel Drown. The GNUPLOT in this package is
largely based on templates in Daniel Drown's 'chrony-graph' project.
