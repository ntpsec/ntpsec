== DESCRIPTION ==

This utility analyzes files in an NTP log directory and generates
statistical plots from them.  It can report either PNG images or the
GNUPLOT programs to generate them to standard output.  In its default
mode it generates an HTML directory containing an index page and
either (a) all plots, for a single statfiles directory, or (b) a
subset of comparative plots for multiple directories.

The most basic option is -d, which specifies one or more logfile
directories to examine; the default is a single directory,
/var/log/ntpstats.

The -n option allows you to set the sitename shown in the plot title,
and is effective only for the single-directory case. The default is
the basename of the log directory.

The -s, -e and -p options allow you to set the time window to be
reported on. With -s and -e you set the start and end times as either
numeric POSIX time or ISO8601-style timestamps, -
yyyy-mmm-ddThh:mm:ss. Alternatively you can specify either -s or -e
(but not both) and use -p to set the default period in days.  The
default is for the period to be 7 days, the end time to match the last
logfile entry, and the start time to be set so that adding the period
just reaches the last logfile entry.

The -D N set the debug level to N and outputs with more verbosity.  0
is the default, quiet except for all ERRORs and some WARNINGs.  9 is
painfully verbose.

The plot options choose what graph is generated; invoke only one.  By
default, the GNUPLOT for the graph is reported; with -g you get the
rendered PNG.

The following plots are available:

--all-peer-jitters::
   Report all peer jitters.  This is a different option name from
   --peer-offsets only because of a limitation in the Python
   standard library.

--all-peer-offsets::
   Report all peer offsets.  This is a different option name from
   --peer-offsets only because of a minor limitation in the Python
   standard library.

--local-error::
   Clock frequency offset from the loop statistics (field 4)

--local-jitter::
   Clock time-jitter plot from the loop statistics (field 5).

--local-offset::
   Clock time and clock frequency offsets from the loop statistics
   (fields 3 and 4).

--local-offset-histogram::
   Frequency histogram of distinct loopstats time offset values (field 3).

--local-offset-multiplot::
   Plot comparative local offsets for multiple directories.

--local-temps::
   Plot comparative local temperatures.  This plot is only generated if
   there is a log file named temps in the log file directory.

--local-stability::
   RMS frequency-jitter plot from the loop statistics (field 6).
   This is deviation from a root-mean-square extrapolation of the
   moving average of past frequency readings.

--peer-jitter=host1[,host2...]::
   Peer jitter from local clock time, from peerstats (field 7)
   A comma-separated list of peer names must follow. It is a fatal
   error for any of these names not to appear in peerstats.

--peer-offsets=host1[,host2...]::
   Peer offset from local clock time from peerstats (field 4). A
   comma-separated list of peer names or IP addresses must follow. It
   is a fatal error for any of these names not to appear in peerstats.

If no individual plot is specified, all plots and an index HTML page
are generated into a new output directory.  Normally this directory is
named 'ntpgraphs', but the name can be changed with the -o option.
Warning: existing PNG files and index.html in this directory will be
clobbered.

When an index is generated, ntpviz will look for two files in the
output directory.  Neither file need be present, and both files may
contain aribtrary HTML.

The first file is named 'header'.  The contents of that file will be
added almost at the top of the body on the generated index page.

This is the place to put links to other web pages, or headline notes.

The second file is named 'footer'.  The contents of that file will be
added almost at the bottom of the body on the generated index.

It is suggested that notes on the server be included in the footer
file: OS, versions, CPU speed, etc.  You may also put links there.

The code includes various sanity checks and will bail out with a message to
standard error on, for example, missing logfile data required for a plot.

== REQUIREMENTS ==

Python and GNUPLOT.  The plots will look better with the 'liberation'
font package installed.

== AUTHORS ==

Eric S. Raymond, Gary E. Miller, and Daniel Drown. The GNUPLOT in this
package is largely based on templates in Daniel Drown's 'chrony-graph'
project.
