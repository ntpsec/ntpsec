    [+-46+] [+-c+ 'command'] [+-e+ 'expiry'] [+-f+ 'config'] [+-F+] [+-h+]
	[+-i+ 'interval'] [+-l+] [+L+] [+-p+ {4|6}] [+-P+ 'logfacility'] [+-q+]
	[+-r+ 'retries'] [+-s+ 'source-url'] [+-t+ 'path'] [+-v+] [+-z+ 'path']
	[+-Z+] ['leapfile']

== DESCRIPTION ==

`ntpleapfetch` will validate the file currently on the local system and
if necessary, updates leap-second definition file.

Ordinarily, the file is found using the "leapfile" directive in
_{ntpdconfman}_. However, an alternate location can be specified on the
command line.

If the file does not exist, is not valid, has expired, or is expiring
soon, a new copy will be downloaded. If the new copy validates, it is
installed and NTP is (optionally) restarted.

If the current file is acceptable, no download or restart occurs.

-c can also be used to invoke another script to perform administrative
functions, e.g. to copy the file to other local systems.

This can be run as a cron job. As the file is rarely updated, and leap
seconds are announced at least one month in advance (usually longer), it
need not be run more frequently than about once every three weeks.

For cron-friendly behavior, define CRONJOB=1 in the crontab.

+-e+ 'expiry'::

+-f+ 'config'::
  Location of the {ntpconf} file.
+
Specify location of {ntpconf} (used to make sure leapfile directive is
present and to default leapfile) /etc/{ntpconf}

+-F+::
  Force update even if current file is OK and not close to expiring.

+-i+ 'interval'::
  Number of minutes between retries.

+-h+::
  Display inline help.

+-L+::

+-P+ 'logfacility'::
  Specify the syslog facility for logging.
  
+-q+::

+-r+ 'retries'::
  Number of retries.

+-s+ 'source-url'::
