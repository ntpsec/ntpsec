// Explain failure modes of ntpq and ntpmon

When using the -u option, very old xterms may fail to render &mu;
correctly.  If this happens, be sure your xterm is started with the -u8
option, or the 'utf8' resource', and that your console font contains
the UTF-8 &mu character.  Also confirm your LANG environment variable is
set to a UTF-8 language, like this: "export LANG=en_US.utf8".

Timestamp interpretation in this program is likely to fail in flaky
ways if the local system clock has not already been approximately
synchronized to UTC. Querying a server based in a different
NTP era than the current one is especially likely to fail.

This program will behave in apparently buggy and only semi-predictable
ways when fetching MRU lists from _any_ server with sufficiently high
traffic.

The problem is fundamental. The Mode 6 protocol can't ship (and your
client cannot accept) MRU records as fast as the daemon accepts
incoming traffic. Under these circumstances, the daemon will
repeatedly fail to ship an entire report, leading to long
hangs as your client repeatedly re-sends the request. Eventually the
Mode 6 client library will throw an error indicating that a maximum
number of restarts has been exceeded.

To avoid this problem, avoid monitoring over links that don't have
enough capacity to handle the monitored server's _entire_ NTP load.
