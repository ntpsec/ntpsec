// Authentication commands - included twice

[[controlkey]]
+controlkey+ _key_::
  Specifies the key identifier to use with the
  {ntpqman} utility, which uses the standard protocol defined in
  RFC 5905. The _key_ argument is the key identifier for a trusted key,
  where the value can be in the range 1 to 65,534, inclusive.

+crypto+ [+cert+ _file_] [+leap+ _file_] [+randfile+ _file_] [+host+ _file_] [+sign+ _file_] [+gq+ _file_] [+gqpar+ _file_] [+iffpar+ _file_] [+mvpar+ _file_] [+pw+ _password_]::
  This command requires the OpenSSL library. It activates public key
  cryptography, selects the message digest and signature encryption
  scheme and loads the required private and public values described
  above. If one or more files are left unspecified, the default names
  are used as described above. Unless the complete path and name of the
  file are specified, the location of a file is relative to the keys
  directory specified in the +keysdir+ command or default
  +{prefixdir}/etc+. Following are the subcommands:

  +cert+ _file_;;
    Specifies the location of the required host public certificate file.
    This overrides the link _ntpkey_cert_hostname_ in the keys
    directory.
  +digest+ _digest_;;
    Specify the message digest algorithm, with default MD5. If the
    OpenSSL library is installed, +digest+ can be be any message digest
    algorithm supported by the library. The current selections are:
    +MD2+, +MD4+, +MD5,+ +MDC2+, +RIPEMD160+, +SHA+ and +SHA1+.
    Note: If compliance with FIPS 140-2 is required, the algorithm
    must be ether +SHA+ or +SHA1+.
  +gqpar+ _file_;;
    Specifies the location of the optional GQ parameters file. This
    overrides the link _ntpkey_gq_hostname_ in the keys directory.
  +host+ _file_;;
    Specifies the location of the required host key file. This overrides
    the link _ntpkey_key_hostname_ in the keys directory.
  +iffpar+ _file_;;
    Specifies the location of the optional IFF parameters file.This
    overrides the link _ntpkey_iff_hostname_ in the keys directory.
  +leap+ _file_;;
    Specifies the location of the optional leapsecond file. This
    overrides the link _ntpkey_leap_ in the keys directory.
  +mvpar+ _file_;;
    Specifies the location of the optional MV parameters file. This
    overrides the link _ntpkey_mv_hostname_ in the keys directory.
  +pw+ _password_;;
    Specifies the password to decrypt files containing private keys and
    identity parameters. This is required only if these files have been
    encrypted.
  +randfile+ _file_;;
    Specifies the location of the random seed file used by the OpenSSL
    library. The defaults are described in the main text above.
  +sign+ _file_;;
    Specifies the location of the optional sign key file. This overrides
    the link _ntpkey_sign_hostname_ in the keys directory. If this file
    is not found, the host key is also the sign key.

[[keys]]
+keys+ _keyfile_::
  Specifies the complete path and location of the MD5 key file
  containing the keys and key identifiers used by {ntpdman},
  and {ntpqman} when operating with symmetric-key cryptography.
  This is the same operation as the +-k+ command line option.

+keysdir+ _path_::
  This command specifies the default directory path for cryptographic
  keys, parameters and certificates. The default is +{prefixdir}/etc/+.

[[trustedkey]]
+trustedkey+ _key..._ ::
  Specifies the key identifiers which are trusted for the purposes of
  authenticating peers with symmetric key cryptography, as well as keys
  used by the {ntpqman} program. The
  authentication procedures require that both the local and remote
  servers share the same key and key identifier for this purpose,
  although different keys can be used with different servers.
  The _key_ arguments are 32-bit unsigned integers with values from 1 to
  65,534.
