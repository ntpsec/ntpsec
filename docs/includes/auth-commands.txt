// Authentication commands - included twice

[[controlkey]]
+controlkey+ _key_::
  Specifies the key identifier to use with the
  {ntpqman} utility, which uses the standard protocol defined in
  RFC 5905. The _key_ argument is the key identifier for a trusted key,
  where the value can be in the range 1 to 65,534, inclusive.

[[keys]]
+keys+ _keyfile_::
  Specifies the complete path and location of the MD5/SHA1 key file
  containing the keys and key identifiers used by {ntpdman},
  and {ntpqman} when operating with symmetric-key cryptography.
  This is the same operation as the +-k+ command line option.

[[trustedkey]]
+trustedkey+ _key..._ ::
  Specifies the key identifiers which are trusted for the purposes of
  authenticating peers with symmetric key cryptography, as well as keys
  used by the {ntpqman} program. The
  authentication procedures require that both the local and remote
  servers share the same key and key identifier for this purpose,
  although different keys can be used with different servers.
  The _key_ arguments are 32-bit unsigned integers with values from 1 to
  65,534.
