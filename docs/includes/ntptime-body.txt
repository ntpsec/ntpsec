// This is the body of the manual page for ntptime.
// It's included in two places: once for the docs/ HTML

== Synopsis ==
[verse]
ntptime [+-chr+] [+-e+ 'est_error'] [+-f+ 'frequency'] [-j]
        [+-m+ 'max_error'] [+-o+ 'offset'] [+-s+ 'status']
        [+-t+ 'time_constant']

== Description ==

Checks the kernel configuration for the NTP user interface
syscalls +ntp_gettime()+ and +ntp_adjtime()+.  If present, the current
timekeeping data are displayed.  If not, a disappointment is
displayed.  See the kernel page file in the HTML documentation in
distribution for further details.

A similar display can be obtained using the +ntpq+ program
and +kerninfo+ command.

This program is useful only with kernels featuring the ntp_adjtime(2)
system call or local equivalent, as described in the link:kern.html[A
Kernel Model for Precision Timekeeping] page,

== Options ==

+-c+::
  Display the execution time of +ntptime+ itself.
+-e+ 'est_error'::
  Specify estimated error, in microseconds.
+-f+ 'frequency'::
  Specify frequency offset, in parts per million.
+-h+::
  Display help information.
+-j+::
  Report in JSON rather than plain text.
+-m+ 'max_error'::
  Specify max possible errors, in microseconds.
+-o+ 'offset'::
  Specify clock offset, in microseconds.
+-r+::
  Display Unix and NTP times in raw format.
+-s+ 'status'::
  Specify clock status. Better know what you are doing.
+-t+ 'time_constant'::
  Specify time constant, an integer in the range 0-10.
+-V+::
  Print the version string and exit.

== Bugs ==

The format for modes and status in the JSON report is less than ideal.
