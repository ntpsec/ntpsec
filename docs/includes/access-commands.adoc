// Access control commands. Is included twice.

[[discard]]
+discard+ [+average+ _avg_] [+minimum+ _min_] [+monitor+ _prob_]::
  Set the parameters of the +limited+ facility which protects the server
  from client abuse. The +average+ subcommand specifies the minimum
  average packet spacing, while the +minimum+ subcommand specifies the
  minimum packet spacing. Packets that violate these minima are
  discarded and a kiss-o'-death packet returned if enabled. The default
  minimum average and minimum are 5 and 2, respectively. The monitor
  subcommand specifies the probability of discard for packets that
  overflow the rate-control window. The options are:
  +average+ 'avg';;
    Specify the minimum average interpacket spacing (minimum average
    headway time) in log~2~ s with default 3.
  +minimum+ 'min';;
    Specify the minimum interpacket spacing (guard time) in seconds with
    default 2.
  +monitor+;;
    Specify the probability of being recorded for packets that overflow
    the MRU list size limit set by +mru maxmem+ or +mru maxdepth+; this
    is a performance optimization for servers with aggregate arrivals of
    1000 packets per second or more.

[[restrict]]
+restrict+ _address_[/_cidr_] [+mask+ _mask_] [+flag+ +...+]::
  The _address_ argument expressed in dotted-quad (for IPv4) or
  :-delimited (for IPv6) form is the address of a
  host or network. Alternatively, the _address_ argument can be a valid
  host DNS name. The _mask_ argument expressed in IPv4 or IPv6 numeric
  address form defaults to all mask bits on, meaning that the _address_ is
  treated as the address of an individual host.  Instead of an explicit
  _mask_, the _address/cidr_ may be specified in CIDR notation.  A
  default entry (address +0.0.0.0+, mask +0.0.0.0+) is always included
  and is always the first entry in the list. Note that text string
  _default_, with no mask option, may be used to indicate the default
  entry. In the current implementation, _flag_ always restricts access,
  i.e., an entry with no flags indicates that free access to the server
  is to be given. The flags are not orthogonal, in that more restrictive
  flags will often make less restrictive ones redundant. The flags can
  generally be classed into two categories, those which restrict time
  service and those which restrict informational queries and attempts
  to do a run-time reconfiguration of the server. One or more of the
  following flags may be specified:
+
--
  +flake+;;
    Discard received NTP packets with probability 0.1; that is, on
    average drop one packet in ten. This flag is for testing and amusement.
    The name comes from Bob Braden's _flakeway_, which once did a
    similar thing for early Internet testing.
  +ignore+;;
    Deny packets of all kinds, including {ntpqman} queries.
  +kod+;;
    If this flag is set when an access violation occurs, a kiss-o'-death
    (KoD) packet is sent. KoD packets are rate limited to no more than
    one per second. If another KoD packet occurs within one second after
    the last one, the packet is dropped.
  +limited+;;
    Deny service if the packet spacing violates the lower limits
    specified in the discard command. A history of clients is kept using
    the monitoring capability of {ntpdman}. Thus, monitoring is
    always active as long as there is a restriction entry with
    the limited flag.
  +mssntp+;;
    Enable Microsoft Windows MS-SNTP authentication using Active
    Directory services. *Note: Potential users should be aware that
    these services involve a TCP connection to another process that
    could potentially block, denying services to other users. Therefore,
    this flag should be used only for a dedicated server with no clients
    other than MS-SNTP.*
  +nomodify+;;
    Deny {ntpqman} queries which attempt
    to modify the state of the server (i.e., run time reconfiguration).
    Queries which return information are permitted.
  +noquery+;;
    Deny {ntpqman} queries. Time service is not affected.
  +nopeer+;;
    Deny packets which would result in mobilizing a new association;
    this includes symmetric active packets when a
    configured association does not exist.  That used to happen
    when the remote client used the +peer+ command in its config file.
    We don't support that mode.
    It used to include _pool_ servers, but they now poke a hole in any
    restrictions.
  +noserve+;;
    Deny all packets except {ntpqman} and queries.
  +notrust+;;
    Deny service unless the packet is cryptographically authenticated.
  +ntpport+;;
    This is a match algorithm modifier, rather than a
    restriction flag. Its presence causes the restriction entry to be
    matched if the source port in the packet is the standard NTP
    UDP port (123). Both +ntpport+ and +non-ntpport+ may be specified.
    The +ntpport+ is considered more specific and is sorted later in the
    list.
  +nomrulist+;;
    Do not accept MRU-list requests.  These can be expensive to
    service and may generate a high volume of response traffic.
  +version+;;
    Deny packets that do not match the current NTP version.
--
+
Default restriction list entries with the flags ignore, interface,
ntpport, for each of the local host's interface addresses are inserted
into the table at startup to prevent the server from attempting to
synchronize to its own time. A default entry is also always present,
though if it is otherwise unconfigured; no flags are associated with
the default entry (i.e., everything besides your own NTP server is
unrestricted).

[[restrict]]
+unrestrict+ _address_[/_cidr_] [+mask+ _mask_] [+flag+ +...+]::
   Like a +restrict+ command, but turns off the specified flags rather
   than turning them on (expected to be useful mainly with ntpq
   :config). An unrestrict with no flags specified removes any rule
   with matching address and mask.  Use only on an address/mask or
   CIDR-format address mentioned in a previous +restrict+ statement.
