== Synopsis ==

`sntp [{--help -?}][{-4 -6}][-a keynum][-b bcaddress][-B bctimeout][-c][-d][-D debug-level][-g delay][-K kodfile][-k keyfile][-l logfile][-M steplimit][-o ntpver][-r][-S][-s][-u uctimeout][--wait][--version][address(es)]`

== Description ==

This program is a Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) client that can be
used to query a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server and display the time
offset of the system clock relative to the server clock. Run as root it
can correct the system clock to this offset as well. It can be run as an
interactive command or from a script by a `cron` job. The program
implements the SNTP client protocol defined in RFC 5905, including the
full on-wire protocol but does not provide the sanity checks, access
controls, security functions and mitigation algorithms as in the full
NTP version 4 specification, also defined in RFC 5905.

By default, `sntp` writes the local date and time (i.e., not UTC) to the
standard output in the format

`2011-08-04 00:40:36.642222 (+0000) +0.006611 +/- 0.041061  psp-os1 149.20.68.26 s3 no-leap`

where the `+0.006611 +/- 0.041061` indicates the time offset and error
bound of the system clock relative to the server clock, in seconds. The
hostname and/or the IP is displayed, as is the stratum of the server.
Finally, the leap indicator status is displayed.

If -b _bcaddress_ is not specified, the program sends a single message
to each address and waits up to _uctimeout_ (default 5) seconds for a
unicast server response. Otherwise, it sends no message and waits up to
_bctimeout_ (default 68) seconds for a broadcast NTP message.

== Options ==

`sntp` recognizes the following options:

`-?, --help`::
  displays usage information. The short form typically requires shell
  quoting, such as `-\?`, otherwise `?` is consumed by the shell.
`-4, --ipv4`::
  When resolving hostnames to IP addresses, use IPv4 addresses only.
`-6, --ipv6`::
  When resolving hostnames to IP addresses, use IPv6 addresses only.
`-a` 'keynum', `--authentication` 'keynum'::
  Enable authentication with the key ID _keynum_. _keynum_ is a number
  specified in the keyfile along with an authentication secret (password
  or digest). See the `-k, --keyfile` option for more details.
`-b 'bcaddress', `--broadcast bcaddress`::
  Listen for NTP packets sent to the broadcast or multicast address
  _bcaddress_, which can be a DNS name or IP address. The default
  maximum time to listen for broadcasts/multicasts, 68 seconds, can be
  modified with the `-B, --bctimeout` option.
`-B` 'bctimeout', `--bctimeout` 'bctimeout'::
  Wait _bctimeout_ seconds for broadcast or multicast NTP message before
  terminating. The default is 68 seconds, chosen because ntpd typically
  transmits broadcasts/multicasts every 64 seconds. Note that the short
  option is `-B`, an uppercase letter B.
`-c, --concurrent`::
  Concurrently query all addresses returned for hostname. Requests from
  an NTP client to a single server should never be sent more often than
  once every two seconds. By default, all addresses resolved from a
  single hostname are assumed to be for a single instance of ntpd, and
  therefore sntp will send queries to these addresses one after another,
  waiting two seconds between queries. This option indicates multiple
  addresses returned for a hostname are on different machines, so sntp
  can send concurrent queries. This is appropriate when using
  *.pool.ntp.org, for example.
`-d, --debug-level`::
  Increase debug verbosity level by one. May be specified multiple
  times. See also the `-D, --set-debug-level` option.
`-D` 'debug-level', `--set-debug-level` 'debug-level'::
  Set the debug verbosity level to _debug-level_. The default level is
  zero. Note that the short option is `-D`, an uppercase letter D. See
  also the `-d, --debug-level` option.
`-g` 'delay', `--gap delay`::
  Specify the _delay_ in milliseconds between outgoing queries,
  defaulting to 50. `sntp` sends queries to all provided
  hostnames/addresses in short succession, and by default terminates
  once the first valid response is received. With multiple time sources
  provided, all but one will not be used. To limit the number of queries
  whose responses will not be used, each query is separated from the
  preceding one by _delay_ milliseconds, to allow time for responses to
  earlier queries to be received. A larger _delay_ reduces the query
  load on the time sources, increasing the time to receive a valid
  response if the first source attempted is slow or unreachable.
`-K` 'kodfile', `--kod` 'kodfile'::
  Specifies the filename _kodfile_ to be used for the persistent history
  of KoD (Kiss Of Death, or rate-limiting) responses received from
  servers. The default is `/var/db/ntp-kod`. If the file does not exist,
  a warning message will be displayed. The file will not be created.
  Note that the short option is `-K`, an uppercase letter K.
`-k` 'keyfile', `--keyfile` 'keyfile'::
  Specifies the filename _keyfile_ used with the `-a`/`--authentication`
  option. The format of the file is described on the
  link:keygen.html[`ntp-keygen` page].
`-l` 'logfile', `--filelog` 'logfile'::
  Specifies the filename in which to append a copy of status messages,
  which also appear on the terminal.
`-M` 'steplimit', `--steplimit` 'steplimit'::
  If both `-S`/`--step` and `-s`/`--slew` options are provided, an
  offset of less than _steplimit_ milliseconds will be corrected by
  slewing the clock using adjtime(), while an offset of _steplimit_ or
  more will be corrected by setting the clock to the corrected time.
  Note that the short option is `-M`, an uppercase letter M.
`-o` 'ntpver', `--ntpversion` 'ntpver'::
  Specifies the NTP protocol version number _ntpver_ to include in
  requests, default 4. This option is rarely useful.
`-r, --usereservedport`::
  By default, `sntp` uses a UDP source port number selected by the
  operating system. When this option is used, the reserved NTP port 123
  is used, which most often requires `sntp` be invoked as the superuser
  (commonly "root"). This can help identify connectivity failures due to
  port-based firewalling which affect `ntpd`, which always uses source
  port 123.
`-S, --step`::
  By default, `sntp` displays the clock offset but does not attempt to
  correct it. This option enables offset correction by stepping, that
  is, directly setting the clock to the corrected time. This typically
  requires `sntp` be invoked as the superuser ("root"). Note that the
  short option is `-S`, an uppercase letter S.
`-s, --slew`::
  By default, `sntp` displays the clock offset but does not attempt to
  correct it. This option enables offset correction by slewing using
  adjtime(), which changes the rate of the clock for a period long
  enough to accomplish the required offset (phase) correction. This
  typically requires `sntp` be invoked as the superuser ("root").
`-u` 'uctimeout', `--uctimeout` 'uctimeout'::
  Specifies the maximum time _uctimeout_ in seconds to wait for a
  unicast response before terminating.
`--wait`::
  When neither `-S`/`--step` nor `-s`/`--slew` options are provided,
  `sntp` will by default terminate after the first valid response is
  received. This option causes `sntp` to instead wait for all pending
  queries' responses.
`--version`::
  Display the `sntp` program's version number and the date and time it
  was compiled.

== Return Value ==

The program returns an exit status of zero for if a valid response is
received and non-zero otherwise.

== Author ==

This `sntp` was originally developed by Johannes Maximilian Kuehn.
Harlan Stenn and Dave Hart modified it to query more than one server at
a time. See the file `ChangeLog` in the distribution for details.
