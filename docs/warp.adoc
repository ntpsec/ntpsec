This page and its dependencies contain a technical description of the
Network Time Protocol (NTP) architecture and operation. It is intended
for administrators, operators and monitoring personnel. Additional
information for nontechnical readers can be found in the white paper
{millshome}exec.html[Executive Summary: Computer
Network Time Synchronization]. While this page and its dependencies are
primarily concerned with NTP, additional information on related
protocols can be found in the white papers
{millshome}ptp.html[IEEE 1588 Precision Time
Protocol (PTP)] and {millshome}proximity.html[Time
Synchronization for Space Data Links]. Note that reference to a page in
this document collection is to a page in the collection, while reference
to a _white paper_ is to a document at the
{millshome}ntp.html[Network Time Synchronization
Research Project] web site.


[[intro]]
== Introduction and Overview ==

NTP time synchronization services are widely available in the public
Internet. The public NTP subnet currently includes several thousand
servers in most countries and on every continent of the globe, including
Antarctica, and sometimes in space and on the sea floor.

The NTP subnet operates with a hierarchy of levels, where each level is
assigned a number called the stratum. Stratum 1 (primary) servers at the
lowest level are directly synchronized to national time services via
satellite, radio or telephone modem. Stratum 2 (secondary) servers at
the next higher level are synchronized to stratum 1 servers and so on.
Normally, NTP clients and servers with a relatively small number of
clients do not synchronize to public primary servers. There are several
hundred public secondary servers operating at higher strata and are the
preferred choice.

This page presents an overview of the NTP implementation included in
this software distribution. We refer to this implementation as the
_reference implementation_ only because it was used to test and validate
the NTPv4 specification RFC 5905. It is best read in conjunction with
the briefings and white papers on the
{millshome}ntp.html[Network Time Synchronization
Research Project] page. An executive summary suitable for management and
planning purposes is in the white paper
{millshome}exec.html[Executive Summary: Computer
Network Time Synchronization].

[[scale]]
== NTP Timescale and Data Formats ==

NTP clients and servers synchronize to the Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC) timescale used by national laboratories and disseminated by radio,
satellite and telephone modem. This is a global timescale independent of
geographic position. There are no provisions to correct for local time
zone or daylight savings time; however, these functions can be performed
by the operating system on a per-user basis.

The UT1 timescale, upon which UTC is based, is determined by the
rotation of the Earth about its axis. The Earth rotation is gradually
slowing down relative to International Atomic Time (TAI). In order to
rationalize UTC with respect to TAI, a leap second is inserted at
intervals, historically averaging about 18 months, as determined by the
https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Home/home_node.html [International Earth
Rotation Service (IERS)]. Reckoning with leap seconds in the NTP
timescale is described in the white paper
{millshome}leap.html[The NTP Timescale and Leap Seconds].

The historic insertions are documented in the +leap-seconds.list+ file,
which can be downloaded from the NIST FTP servers. This file is updated
at intervals not exceeding six months. Leap second warnings are
disseminated by the national laboratories in the broadcast timecode
format. These warnings are propagated from the NTP primary servers via
other server to the clients by the NTP on-wire protocol. The leap second
is implemented by the operating system kernel, as described in the white
paper {millshome}leap.html[The NTP Timescale and
Leap Seconds]. Implementation details are described on the
link:leap.html[Leap Second Processing] page.

Figure 1. NTP Timestamp format

Figure 1 shows the timestamp format used in packet headers exchanged
between clients and servers.  Ordinarily, this timestamp format is not
seen by application programs, which converts it to native formats such
as ISO 8601 or RFC 822-style Gregorian-calendar dates.

The timestamp format spans 136 years, called an _era_. Conceptually,
it is helpful to think of an absolute dates as being a tuple of one of
these timestamps and an era number. The current era, era 0, began on 1
January 1900, while the next one begins in 2036.

Details on converting between era-timestamp pairs and timestamps are
in the white paper {millshome}y2k.html[The NTP Era and Era
Numbering]. The NTP protocol will synchronize correctly, regardless of
era, as long as the system clock is set initially within 68 years (a
half-era) of the correct time. Further discussion on this issue is in
the white paper {millshome}time.html[NTP Timestamp Calculations].

Figure 2. NTP Daemon Processes and Algorithms

The overall organization of the NTP architecture is shown in Figure 2.
It is useful in this context to consider the implementation as both a
client of upstream (lower stratum) servers and as a server for
downstream (higher stratum) clients. It includes a pair of peer/poll
processes for each reference clock or remote server used as a
synchronization source. Packets are exchanged between the client and
server using the _on-wire protocol_ described in the white paper
{millshome}onwire.html[Analysis and Simulation of
the NTP On-Wire Protocols]. The protocol is resistant to lost, replayed
or spoofed packets.

The poll process sends NTP packets at intervals ranging from 1 s to
2^17 s (36.4 hr). The intervals are managed as described on the
link:poll.html[Poll Process] page to maximize accuracy while
minimizing network load. The peer process receives NTP packets and
performs the packet sanity tests described on the
link:decode.html[Event Messages and Status Words] page
and link:decode.html#flash[flash status word]. The flash status word
reports in addition the results of various access control and security
checks described in the white paper
{millshome}security.html[NTP Security Analysis]. A
sophisticated traffic monitoring facility described on the
link:rate.html[Rate Management and the Kiss-o'-Death Packet] page
protects against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

Packets that fail one or more of these tests are summarily discarded.
Otherwise, the peer process runs the on-wire protocol that uses four raw
timestamps: the _origin timestamp_ _T_~1~ upon departure of the client
request, the _receive timestamp_ _T_~2~ upon arrival at the server, the
_transmit timestamp_ _T_~3~ upon departure of the server reply, and the
_destination timestamp_ _T_~4~ upon arrival at the client. These
timestamps, which are recorded by the +rawstats+ option of the
link:monopt.html#filegen[+filegen+] command, are used to calculate the
clock offset and roundtrip delay samples:

[verse]
delay = (_T_~4~ - _T_~1~) - (_T_~3~ - _T_~2~).

The offset and delay statistics for one or more peer processes are
processed by a suite of mitigation algorithms. The algorithm described
on the link:filter.html[Clock Filter Algorithm] page selects the offset
and delay samples most likely to produce accurate results. Those servers
that have passed the sanity tests are declared _selectable_. From the
selectable population the statistics are used by the algorithm described
on the link:select.html[Clock Select Algorithm] page to determine a
number of _truechimers_ according to Byzantine agreement and correctness
principles. From the truechimer population the algorithm described on
the link:cluster.html[Clock Cluster Algorithm] page determines a number
of _survivors_ on the basis of statistical clustering principles.

The algorithms described on the link:prefer.html[Mitigation Rules and
the +prefer+ Keyword] page combine the survivor offsets, designate one
of them as the _system peer_ and produces the final offset used by the
algorithm described on the link:discipline.html[Clock Discipline
Algorithm] page to adjust the system clock time and frequency. The clock
offset and frequency, are recorded by the +loopstats+ option of the
link:monopt.html#filegen[+filegen+] command. For additional details
about these algorithms, see the Architecture Briefing on the
{millshome}ntp.html[Network Time Synchronization
Research Project] page. For additional information on statistical
principles and performance metrics, see the link:stats.html[Performance
Metrics] page.
