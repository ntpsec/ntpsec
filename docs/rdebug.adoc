The link:ntpq.html[+ntpq+] utility program
can be used to debug reference clocks, either on the server itself or
from another machine elsewhere in the network. The server is compiled,
installed and started using the configuration file described in the
link:ntpd.html[+ntpd+] page and its dependencies. If the clock appears
in the +ntpq+ utility and +pe+ command, no errors have occurred and the
daemon has started, opened the devices specified and waiting for peers
and radios to come up. If not, the first thing to look for are error
messages on the system log. These are usually due to improper
configuration, missing links or multiple instances of the daemon.

It normally takes a minute or so for evidence to appear that the clock
is running and the driver is operating correctly. The first indication
is a nonzero value in the +reach+ column in the +pe+ billboard. If
nothing appears after a few minutes, the next step is to be sure the
RS232 messages, if used, are getting to and from the clock. The most
reliable way to do this is with an RS232 tester and to look for data
flashes as the driver polls the clock and/or as data arrive from the
clock. Our experience is that the overwhelming fraction of problems
occurring during installation are due to problems such as miswired
connectors or improperly configured device links at this stage.

If RS232 messages are getting to and from the clock, the variables of
interest can be inspected using the +ntpq+ program and various commands
described on the documentation page. First, use the +pe+ and +as+
commands to display billboards showing the peer configuration and
association IDs for all peers, including the radio clock. The assigned
clock address should appear in the +pe+ billboard and the association ID
for it at the same relative line position in the +as+ billboard.

Additional information is available with the +rv+ and +clockvar+
commands, which take as argument the association ID shown in the +as+
billboard. The +rv+ command with no argument shows the system variables,
while the +rv+ command with association ID argument shows the peer
variables for the clock, as well as other peers of interest. The
+clockvar+ command with argument shows the peer variables specific to
reference clock peers, including the clock status, device name, last
received timecode (if relevant), and various event counters. In
addition, a subset of the driver options is included. The poll and
error counters in the +clockvar+ billboard are useful debugging aids.
The +poll+ counts the poll messages sent to the clock, while the
+noreply+, +badformat+ and +baddate+ count various errors. Check the
timecode to be sure it matches what the driver expects. This may require
consulting the clock hardware reference manual, which is probably pretty
dusty at this stage.

The +ntpq+ utility program can be used for detailed inspection of the
clock driver status. The most useful are the +clockstat+ and +clkbug+
commands described in the document page. While these commands permit
getting quite personal with the particular driver involved, their use is
seldom necessary, unless an implementation bug shows up. If all else
fails, turn on the debugging trace using two +-d+ flags in the +ntpd+
startup command line. Most drivers will dump status at every received
message in this case. While the displayed trace can be intimidating,
this provides the most detailed and revealing indicator of how the
driver and clock are performing and where bugs might lurk.

Most drivers write a message to the +clockstats+ file as each timecode
or surrogate is received from the radio clock. By convention, this is
the last ASCII timecode (or ASCII gloss of a binary-coded one) received
from the radio clock. This file is managed by the +filegen+ facility
described in the +ntpd+ page and requires specific commands in the
configuration file. This forms a highly useful record to discover
anomalies during regular operation of the clock. The scripts included in
the +./scripts/stats+ directory can be run from a +cron+ job to collect
and summarize these data on a daily or weekly basis. The summary files
have proven inspirational to detect infrequent misbehavior due to clock
implementation bugs in some radios.
