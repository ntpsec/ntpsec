Figure 1. Typical Symmetric Key File

Figure 1 shows a typical symmetric keys file used by the reference
implementation. Each line of the file contains three fields, first an
integer between 1 and 65534, inclusive, representing the key identifier
used in the `server` and `peer` configuration commands. Next is the key
type for the message digest algorithm, which can be any
message digest algorithm supported by the OpenSSL library. However, if
compatibility with FIPS 140-2 is required, the key type must be
`SHA1`. The key type can be changed using an ASCII text editor.

An MD5 key consists of a printable ASCII string less than or equal to 16
characters and terminated by whitespace or a # character. An OpenSSL key
consists of a hex-encoded ASCII string of 40 characters, which is
truncated as necessary.
