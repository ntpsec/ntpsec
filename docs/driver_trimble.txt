== GPS Receiver ==

The Palisade GPS receiver is an 8-channel smart antenna, housing the GPS
receiver, antenna and interface in a single unit, and is designed for
rooftop deployment in static timing applications.

Palisade generates a PPS synchronized to UTC within +/- 100 ns.  The
Palisade's external event input with 40 nanosecond resolution is
utilized by the Palisade NTP driver for asynchronous precision time
transfer.

No user initialization of the receiver is required. This driver is compatible with the following versions of Palisade:

[width="50%",cols="<34%,<33%,<33%",align="center",frame="none",grid="none"]
|======================================================
| Version  | Event Input  |Trimble Part Number
| 7.02     | No           |26664-00
| 7.02E    | Yes          | 26664-10
| 7.12     | Yes          | 38158-00
|======================================================

Note: When using Palisade 26664-00, you must set the +flag2+ option to 1 in
*{ntpconf}*. See link:#Configuration[configuration].

== GPS Installation ==

A location with unobstructed view of the horizon is recommended.
Palisade is designed to be securely mounted atop standard 3/4 inch
threaded pipe.

The 12 conductor (dia. 10 mm)  power and I/O cable must be routed from
the rooftop site to the NTP server and properly strain relieved.

== GPS Connection ==

The Palisade is equipped with dual (A & B) RS-422 serial interfaces and
a differential TTL PPS output. An RS-232 / RS-422 Interface Module is
supplied with the Palisade NTP Synchronization Kit. Palisade
link:#PortA[port A] must be connected to the NTP host server. Maximum
antenna cable length is 500 meters. See the link:#Pinouts[pinouts] table
for detailed connection Information.

Palisade's link:#PortB[port B] provides a TSIP (Trimble Standard
Interface Protocol) interface for diagnostics, configuration, and
monitoring. Port B and the PPS output are not currently used by the
Palisade NTP reference clock driver.

== O/S Serial Port Configuration ==

The driver attempts to open the device +/dev/trimble+__u__ where 'u' is
the NTP refclock unit number as defined by the LSB of the refclock
address.  Valid refclock unit numbers are 0 - 3.

The user is expected to provide a symbolic link to an available serial
port device.  This is typically performed by a command such as:

---------------------------------
ln -s /dev/ttyS0 /dev/trimble0
---------------------------------

Windows NT does not support symbolic links to device files. COM**x**: is
used by the driver, based on the refclock unit number, where unit 1
corresponds to COM**1**: and unit 3 corresponds to COM3:.

The Palisade ships 8N1 (no parity).  The Thunderbolt ships 8O1 (odd
parity).

[[Configuration]]
== NTP Configuration ==

Trimble NTP configuration file "{ntpconf}" with event polling:

["literal",subs="normal"]
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The Primary reference
refclock trimble unit 0
peer terrapin.csc.ncsu.edu # internet server
# Drift file for expedient re-synchronization after downtime or reboot.
driftfile /etc/ntp.drift
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration without event polling:

["literal",subs="normal"]
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The Primary reference.
# Set packet delay and set flag2 to turn off event polling.
refclock trimble unit 0 link:#time1[time1 0.020] link:#flag2[flag2 1]
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Thunderbolt NTP Configuration file ==

Configuration without event polling:

["literal",subs="normal"]
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The Primary reference
refclock trimble unit 0 mode 2 link:#time1[time1 0.020] link:#flag2[flag2 1]
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently the Thunderbolt mode doesn't support event polling, the
reasons are explained on the "Notes on the Thunderbolt Receiver's
Firmware" section at the end of this documentation.

== Time Transfer and Polling ==

Time transfer to the NTP host is performed via the Palisade's
comprehensive time packet output. The time packets are output once per
second, and whenever an event timestamp is requested.

The driver requests an event time stamp at the end of each polling
interval, by pulsing the RTS (request to send) line on the serial port.
The Palisade GPS responds with a time stamped event packet.

Time stamps are reported by the Palisade with respect to UTC time. The
GPS receiver must download UTC offset information from GPS satellites.
After an initial UTC download, the receiver will always start with
correct UTC offset information.

== Run NTP in Debugging Mode ==

The following procedure is recommended for installing and testing a
Palisade NTP driver:

1.  Perform initial checkout procedures. Place the GPS receiver
outdoors; with clear view of the sky. Allow the receiver to obtain an
UTC almanac.
2.  Verify presence of timing packets by observing the 1 Hz (PPS) led on
the interface module. It should flash once per second.
3.  Connect Palisade's port A to the NTP host.
4.  Configure NTP and the serial I/O port on the host system.
5.  Initially use the link:#flag2[+flag2+] option in
*link:#Configuration[{ntpconf}],* to disable event polling (see
configuration).
6.  Run NTP in debug mode (-d -d), to observe Palisade_receive events.
7.  The driver reports the link:#TrackingStatus[tracking status of the
receiver]. Make sure it is tracking several satellites.
8.  Remove the +flag2+ option and restart the daemon in debug mode to observe
trimble_receive events.
9.  If event polling fails, verify the link:#Pinouts[connections] and
that the host hardware supports RTS control.

== Event Logging ==

System and Event log entries are generated by NTP to report significant
system events. Administrators should monitor the system log to observe
NTP error messages. Log entries generated by the Palisade NTP reference
clock driver will be of the form:

---------------------------------------------------------
Nov 14 16:16:21 terrapin ntpd[1127]: Palisade #0: message
---------------------------------------------------------

== Driver Options ==
[[time1]]link:#Configuration[+time1+ 'time]'::
   Specifies the time offset calibration factor, in seconds and fraction,
   with default 0.0. If event capture is not used, time1 should be set to
   20 milliseconds to correct serial line and operating system delays
   incurred in capturing time stamps from the synchronous packets.

+stratum number+::
   Specifies the driver stratum, in decimal from 0 to 15, with default 0.

link:#refid[+refid string+]::
   Specifies the driver reference identifier, *GPS*.

+flag1 {0 | 1}+::
  Not used by this driver.

[[flag2]]link:#Configuration[+flag2 {0 | 1}+]::
   When set to 1, driver does not use hardware event capture. The
   synchronous packet output by the receiver at the beginning of each
   second is time stamped by the driver. If triggering the event pulse
   fails, the driver falls back to this mode automatically.

+flag3 {0 | 1}+::
  Not used by this driver.

+flag4 {0 | 1}+::
  Not used by this driver.

+subtype+ 'number'::
   The mode parameter to the server command specifies the specific hardware
   this driver is for. The default is 0 for a normal Trimble Palisade. The
   other options are *1* for an *Endrun Praecis* in Trimble emulation mode,
   *2* for the *Trimble Thunderbolt* GPS Disciplined Clock Receiver,
   *3* for the Trimble Acutime Gold, and *4* for the Acutime Gold port B.

+mode+ 'number'::
   Synonym for subtype, retained for backward compatibility.

+path+ 'filename'::
  Overrides the default device path.

+ppspath+ 'filename'::
  Not used by this driver.

+baud+ 'number'::
  Overrides the default baud rate.

*Note: If driving the RS-422 inputs on the Palisade single ended, i.e.
using the Green and Gray connections only, does not work on all serial
ports. Use of the Palisade NTP Synchronization Interface Module is
recommended.*

*The 12 pin connector pinout definition:*

*Face the round 12 pin connector at the end of the cable, with the
notch Pin 1 is to the left of the notch. Pins 2 - 8 wrap around the
bottom, counterclockwise to pin 9 on the right of the notch. Pin 10
is just below the notch. Pins 10 (top), 11 (bottom left) and 12
(bottom right) form a triangle in the center of the connector.*

*Pinouts for the Palisade NTP host adapter (Trimble PN 37070) DB-25 M
connector are as follows:*

== Notes on the Thunderbolt Receiver's Firmware ==

*The support for Thunderbolt Receiver in the trimble driver doesn't
support (for now) event-polling, the reason is that the Thunderbolt
receiver the patch is written for doesn't support time-on-request, so
you just have to sit there and wait for the time to arrive with the PPS.
We tried to contact Trimble because there's presumably a firmware update
that support it, but we didn't have much luck. Here is a link explaining
the situation:*
