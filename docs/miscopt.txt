== Commands and Options ==

`broadcastdelay` 'delay'::
  In broadcast and multicast modes, means are required to determine the
  network delay between the server and client. Ordinarily, this is done
  automatically by the initial calibration exchanges between the client
  and server. In some cases, the exchange might not be possible due to
  network or server access controls. The value of _`delay`_ is by
  default zero, in which case the exchange is enabled. If _`delay`_ is
  greater than zero, it becomes the roundtrip delay (s), as measured by
  the Unix `ping` program, and the exchange is disabled.
`driftfile` 'driftfile'::
  This command specifies the complete path and name of the file used to
  record the frequency of the local clock oscillator. This is the same
  operation as the `-f` command line option. This command is mutually
  exclusive with the `freq` option of the `tinker` command. 
+
If the file exists, it is read at startup in order to set the initial
frequency and then updated once per hour or more with the current
frequency computed by the daemon. If the file name is specified, but
the file itself does not exist, the starts with an initial frequency
of zero and creates the file when writing it for the first time. If
this command is not given, the daemon will always start with an
initial frequency of zero. 
+
The file format consists of a single line containing a single floating
point number, which records the frequency offset measured in
parts-per-million (PPM). The file is updated by first writing the
current drift value into a temporary file and then renaming this file
to replace the old version.

`enable [auth | bclient | calibrate | kernel | mode7 | monitor | ntp | stats]`::

`disable [auth | bclient | calibrate | kernel | mode7 | monitor | ntp | stats]`::
  Provides a way to enable or disable various system options. Flags not
  mentioned are unaffected. Note that most of these flags can be
  modified remotely using link:ntpq.html[`ntpq`] utility program's
  `:config` and `config-from-file` commands.
  `auth`;;
    Enables the server to synchronize with unconfigured peers only if
    the peer has been correctly authenticated using either public key or
    private key cryptography. The default for this flag is enable.
  `bclient`;;
    Enables the server to listen for a message from a broadcast or
    multicast server, as in the `multicastclient` command with default
    address. The default for this flag is disable.
  `calibrate`;;
    Enables the calibrate feature for reference clocks. The default for
    this flag is disable.
  `kernel`;;
    Enables the kernel time discipline, if available. The default for
    this flag is enable if support is available, otherwise disable.
  `mode7`;;
    Enables processing of NTP mode 7 implementation-specific requests
    which were formerly used by the `ntpdc` program. The default for
    this flag is disable. This flag is excluded from runtime
    configuration using `ntpq`. The `ntpq` program provides the same
    capabilities as `ntpdc` did using standard mode 6 requests.
  `monitor`;;
    Enables the monitoring facility. See the link:ntpq.html[`ntpq`
    program] and the `monstats` and `mrulist` commands, as well as the
    link:accopt.html#discard[Access Control Options] for details. The
    monitoring facility is also enabled by the presence of
    link:accopt.html#limited[`limited`] in any `restrict` commands. The
    default for this flag is enable.
  `ntp`;;
    Enables time and frequency discipline. In effect, this switch opens
    and closes the feedback loop, which is useful for testing. The
    default for this flag is enable.
  `stats`;;
    Enables the statistics facility. See the link:monopt.html[Monitoring
    Options] page for further information. The default for this flag is
    enabled. This flag is excluded from runtime configuration using
    `ntpq`.
`includefile` 'includefile'::
  This command allows additional configuration commands to be included
  from a separate file. Include files may be nested to a depth of five;
  upon reaching the end of any include file, command processing resumes
  in the previous configuration file. This option is useful for sites
  that run `ntpd` on multiple hosts, with (mostly) common options (e.g.,
  a restriction list).
`interface` [`listen | ignore | drop] [all | ipv4 | ipv6 | wildcard` | 'name' | 'address'[/'prefixlen']]::
  This command controls which network addresses `ntpd` opens, and
  whether input is dropped without processing. The first parameter
  determines the action for addresses which match the second parameter.
  That parameter specifies a class of addresses, or a specific interface
  name, or an address. In the address case, _`prefixlen`_ determines how
  many bits must match for this rule to apply. `ignore` prevents opening
  matching addresses, `drop` causes `ntpd` to open the address and drop
  all received packets without examination. Multiple `interface`
  commands can be used. The last rule which matches a particular address
  determines the action for it. `interface` commands are disabled if any
  link:ntpd.html#--interface[`-I`],
  link:ntpd.html#--interface[`--interface`],
  link:ntpd.html#--novirtualips[`-L`], or
  link:ntpd.html#--novirtualips[`--novirtualips`] command-line options
  are used. If none of those options are used and no `interface` actions
  are specified in the configuration file, all available network
  addresses are opened. The `nic` command is an alias for `interface`.
`leapfile` 'leapfile'::
  This command loads the NIST leapseconds file and initializes the
  leapsecond values for the next leapsecond time, expiration time and
  TAI offset. The file can be obtained directly from NIST national time
  servers using `ftp` as the ASCII file `pub/leap-seconds`.
+
The _leapfile_ is scanned when `ntpd` processes the `leapfile`
directive or when `ntpd` detects that _leapfile_ has changed. `ntpd`
checks once a day to see if the _leapfile_ has changed.
+
While not strictly a security function, the Autokey protocol provides
means to securely retrieve the current or updated leapsecond values
from a server.

`logconfig` 'configkeyword'::
  This command controls the amount and type of output written to the
  system `syslog` facility or the alternate `logfile` log file. All
  _`configkeyword`_ keywords can be prefixed with `=`, `+` and `-`,
  where `=` sets the `syslogmask`, `+` adds and `-` removes messages.
  `syslog messages` can be controlled in four classes (`clock`, `peer`,
  `sys` and `sync`). Within these classes four types of messages can be
  controlled: informational messages (`info`), event messages
  (`events`), statistics messages (`statistics`) and status messages
  (`status`).
+
Configuration keywords are formed by concatenating the message class
with the event class. The `all` prefix can be used instead of a
message class. A message class may also be followed by the `all`
keyword to enable/disable all messages of the respective message
class. By default, `logconfig` output is set to `allsync`.
+ 
Thus, a minimal log configuration could look like this:
+ 
`logconfig=syncstatus +sysevents`
+ 
This would just list the synchronizations state of `ntpd` and the
major system events. For a simple reference server, the following
minimum message configuration could be useful:
+ 
`logconfig=syncall +clockall`
+ 
This configuration will list all clock information and synchronization
information. All other events and messages about peers, system events
and so on is suppressed.

`logfile` 'logfile'::
  This command specifies the location of an alternate log file to be
  used instead of the default system `syslog` facility. This is the same
  operation as the `-l` command line option.
`mru` [`maxdepth` 'count' | `maxmem` 'kilobytes' | `mindepth` 'count' | `maxage` 'seconds' | `initalloc` 'count' | `initmem` 'kilobytes' | `incalloc` 'count' | `incmem` 'kilobytes']::
  Controls size limits of the monitoring facility Most Recently Used
  link:ntpq.html#mrulist[(MRU) list] of client addresses, which is also
  used by the link:accopt.html#discard[rate control facility].
  `maxdepth` 'count';;         
  `maxmem` 'kilobytes';;
    Equivalent upper limits on the size of the MRU list, in terms of
    entries or kilobytes. The actual limit will be up to `incalloc`
    entries or `incmem` kilobytes larger. As with all of the `mru`
    options offered in units of entries or kilobytes, if both `maxdepth`
    and `maxmem` are used, the last one used controls. The default is
    1024 kilobytes.
  `mindepth` 'count';;
    Lower limit on the MRU list size. When the MRU list has fewer than
    `mindepth` entries, existing entries are never removed to make room
    for newer ones, regardless of their age. The default is 600 entries.
  `maxage` 'seconds';;
    Once the MRU list has `mindepth` entries and an additional client
    address is to be added to the list, if the oldest entry was updated
    more than `maxage` seconds ago, that entry is removed and its
    storage reused. If the oldest entry was updated more recently, the
    MRU list is grown, subject to `maxdepth`/`maxmem`. The default is 64
    seconds.
  `initalloc` 'count';;         
  `initmem` 'kilobytes';;
    Initial memory allocation at the time the monitoring facility is
    first enabled, in terms of entries or kilobytes. The default is 4
    kilobytes.
  `incalloc` 'count';;         
  `incmem` 'kilobytes';;
    Size of additional memory allocations when growing the MRU list, in
    entries or kilobytes. The default is 4 kilobytes.
`nonvolatile` 'threshold'::
  Specify the _`threshold`_ in seconds to write the frequency file, with
  default of 1e-7 (0.1 PPM). The frequency file is inspected each hour.
  If the difference between the current frequency and the last value
  written exceeds the threshold, the file is written and the `threshold`
  becomes the new threshold value. If the threshold is not exceeded, it
  is reduced by half. This is intended to reduce the frequency of
  unnecessary file writes for embedded systems with nonvolatile memory.
`phone` 'dial ...'::
  This command is used in conjunction with the ACTS modem driver (type
  18). The arguments consist of a maximum of 10 telephone numbers used
  to dial USNO, NIST or European time services. The Hayes command
  ATDT is normally prepended to the number, which can contain other
  modem control codes as well.
`reset [allpeers] [auth] [ctl] [io] [mem] [sys] [timer]`::
  Reset one or more groups of counters maintained by ntpd and exposed by
  `ntpq`.
`saveconfigdir` 'directory_path'::
  Specify the directory in which to write configuration snapshots
  requested with `ntpq`'s link:ntpq.html#saveconfig[saveconfig] command.
  If `saveconfigdir` does not appear in the configuration file,
  saveconfig requests are rejected by ntpd.
`setvar` 'variable' [`default`]::
  This command adds an additional system variable. These variables can
  be used to distribute additional information such as the access
  policy. If the variable of the form `name = value` is followed by the
  `default` keyword, the variable will be listed as part of the default
  system variables (`ntpq rv` command). These additional variables serve
  informational purposes only. They are not related to the protocol
  other that they can be listed. The known protocol variables will
  always override any variables defined via the `setvar` mechanism.
  There are three special variables that contain the names of all
  variable of the same group. The `sys_var_list` holds the names of all
  system variables. The `peer_var_list` holds the names of all peer
  variables and the `clock_var_list` holds the names of the reference
  clock variables.
`tinker` [`allan` 'allan' | `dispersion` 'dispersion' | `freq` 'freq' | `huffpuff` 'huffpuff' | `panic` 'panic' | `step` 'step' | `stepout` 'stepout']::
  This command alters certain system variables used by the clock
  discipline algorithm. The default values of these variables have been
  carefully optimized for a wide range of network speeds and reliability
  expectations. Very rarely is it necessary to change the default
  values; but, some folks can't resist twisting the knobs. Options are
  as follows:
  `allan` 'allan';;
    Specifies the Allan intercept, which is a parameter of the PLL/FLL
    clock discipline algorithm, in seconds with default 1500 s.
  `dispersion` 'dispersion';;
    Specifies the dispersion increase rate in parts-per-million (PPM)
    with default 15 PPM.
  `freq` 'freq';;
    Specifies the frequency offset in parts-per-million (PPM). This
    option is mutually exclusive with the driftfile command.
  `huffpuff` 'huffpuff';;
    Specifies the huff-n'-puff filter span, which determines the most
    recent interval the algorithm will search for a minimum delay. The
    lower limit is 900 s (15 min), but a more reasonable value is 7200
    (2 hours).See the link:huffpuff.html[Huff-n'-Puff Filter] page for
    further information.
  `panic` 'panic';;
    Specifies the panic threshold in seconds with default 1000 s. If set
    to zero, the panic sanity check is disabled and a clock offset of
    any value will be accepted.
  `step` 'step';;
    Specifies the step threshold in seconds. The default without this
    command is 0.128 s. If set to zero, step adjustments will never
    occur. Note: The kernel time discipline is disabled if the step
    threshold is set to zero or greater than 0.5 s. Further details are
    on the link:clock.html[Clock State Machine] page.
  `stepout` 'stepout';;
    Specifies the stepout threshold in seconds. The default without this
    command is 300 s. Since this option also affects the training and
    startup intervals, it should not be set less than the default.
    Further details are on the link:clock.html[Clock State Machine]
    page.
`rlimit` [`memlock` 'Nmegabytes' | `stacksize` 'N4kPages' | `filenum` 'Nfiledescriptors']::
  This command alters certain process storage allocation limits, and is
  only available on some operating systems. Options are as follows:
  `memlock` 'Nmegabytes';;
    Specify the number of megabytes of memory that can be allocated.
    Probably only available under Linux, this option is useful when
    dropping root (the `-i` option). The default is 32 megabytes.
    Setting this to zero will prevent any attemp to lock memory.
  `stacksize` 'N4kPages';;
    Specifies the maximum size of the process stack on systems with the
    `mlockall()` function. Defaults to 50 4k pages (200 4k pages in
    OpenBSD).
  `filenum` 'Nfiledescriptors';;
    Specifies the maximum number of file descriptors ntp may have open
    at the same time. Defaults to system default.
`tos` [`beacon` 'beacon' | `ceiling` 'ceiling' | `cohort` {`0` | `1`} | `floor` 'floor' | `maxclock` 'maxclock' | `maxdist` 'maxdist' | `minclock` 'minclock' | `mindist` 'mindist' | `minsane` 'minsane' | `orphan` 'stratum' | `orphanwait` 'delay']::
  This command alters certain system variables used by the the clock
  selection and clustering algorithms. The default values of these
  variables have been carefully optimized for a wide range of network
  speeds and reliability expectations. Very rarely is it necessary to
  change the default values; but, some folks can't resist twisting the
  knobs. It can be used to select the quality and quantity of peers used
  to synchronize the system clock and is most useful in dynamic server
  discovery schemes. The options are as follows:
  `beacon` 'beacon';;
    The manycast server sends packets at intervals of 64 s if less than
    `maxclock` servers are available. Otherwise, it sends packets at the
    _`beacon`_ interval in seconds. The default is 3600 s. See the
    link:discover.html[Automatic Server Discovery] page for further
    details.
  `ceiling` 'ceiling';;
    Specify the maximum stratum (exclusive) for acceptable server
    packets. The default is 16. See the link:discover.html[Automatic
    Server Discovery] page for further details.
  `cohort` { `0` | `1` };;
    Specify whether (1) or whether not (0) a server packet will be
    accepted for the same stratum as the client. The default is 0. See
    the link:discover.html[Automatic Server Discovery] page for further
    details.
  `floor` 'floor';;
    Specify the minimum stratum (inclusive) for acceptable server
    packets. The default is 1. See the link:discover.html[Automatic
    Server Discovery] page for further details.
  `maxclock` 'maxclock';;
    Specify the maximum number of servers retained by the server
    discovery schemes. The default is 10. See the
    link:discover.html[Automatic Server Discovery] page for further
    details.
  `maxdist` 'maxdistance';;
    Specify the synchronization distance threshold used by the clock
    selection algorithm. The default is 1.5 s. This determines both the
    minimum number of packets to set the system clock and the maximum
    roundtrip delay. It can be decreased to improve reliability or
    increased to synchronize clocks on the Moon or planets.
  `minclock` 'minclock';;
    Specify the number of servers used by the clustering algorithm as
    the minimum to include on the candidate list. The default is 3. This
    is also the number of servers to be averaged by the combining
    algorithm.
  `mindist` 'mindistance';;
    Specify the minimum distance used by the selection and anticlockhop
    algorithm. Larger values increase the tolerance for outliers;
    smaller values increase the selectivity. The default is .001 s. In
    some cases, such as reference clocks with high jitter and a PPS
    signal, it is useful to increase the value to insure the
    intersection interval is always nonempty.
  `minsane` 'minsane';;
    Specify the number of servers used by the selection algorithm as the
    minimum to set the system clock. The default is 1 for legacy
    purposes; however, for critical applications the value should be
    somewhat higher but less than `minclock`.
  `orphan` 'stratum';;
    Specify the orphan stratum with default 16. If less than 16 this is
    the stratum assumed by the root servers. See the
    link:orphan.html[Orphan Mode] page for further details.
  `orphanwait` 'delay';;
    Specify the delay in seconds from the time all sources are lost
    until orphan parent mode is enabled with default 300 s (five
    minutes). During this period, the local clock driver and the modem
    driver are not selectable, unless marked with the `prefer` keyword.
    This allows time for one or more primary sources to become reachable
    and selectable before using backup sources, and avoids transient use
    of the backup sources at startup.
`trap` 'host_address' [`port` 'port_number'] [`interface` 'interfSace_address']::
  This command configures a trap receiver at the given host address and
  port number for sending messages with the specified local interface
  address. If the port number is unspecified, a value of 18447 is used.
  If the interface address is not specified, the message is sent with a
  source address of the local interface the message is sent through.
  Note that on a multihomed host the interface used may vary from time
  to time with routing changes.
+
The trap receiver will generally log event messages and other
information from the server in a log file. While such monitor programs
may also request their own trap dynamically, configuring a trap
receiver will ensure that no messages are lost when the server is
started.

`ttl` 'hop ...'::
  This command specifies a list of TTL values in increasing order. up to
  8 values can be specified. In manycast mode these values are used in
  turn in an expanding-ring search. The default is eight multiples of 32
  starting at 31.
`dscp` 'dscp'::
  This command specifies the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)
  value that is used in sent NTP packets. The default value is 46 for
  Expedited Forwarding (EF).
