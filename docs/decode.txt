[[intro]]
== Introduction ==

This page lists the status words, event messages and error codes used
for +{ntpd}+ reporting and monitoring. Status words are used to display
the current status of the running program. There is one system status
word and a peer status word for each association. There is a clock
status word for each association that supports a reference clock. There
is a flash code for each association which shows errors found in the
last packet received (pkt) and during protocol processing (peer). These
are commonly viewed using the +{ntpq}+ program.

Significant changes in program state are reported as events. There is
one set of system events and a set of peer events for each association.
In addition, there is a set of clock events for each association that
supports a reference clock. Events are normally reported to the
+protostats+ monitoring file and optionally to the system log.
//The now-removed trap feature was mentioned here - we're marking
//this spot in case sometning like it is reintroduced.

In the following tables the Event Field is the status or event code
assigned and the Message Field a short string used for display and event
reporting. The Description field contains a longer explanation of the
status or event. Some messages include additional information useful for
error diagnosis and performance assessment.

[[sys]]
== System Status Word ==

The system status word consists of four fields LI (0-1), Source (2-7),
Count (8-11) and Event (12-15). It is reported in the first line of the
+rv+ display produced by the +{ntpq}+ program.

[width="50%"]
|=======================
|Leap|Source|Count|Event
|=======================

The Leap Field displays the system leap indicator bits coded as follows:

[width="70%",cols=">10%,<30%,<60%",]
|========================================================================
|Code  | Message        | Description
| +0+  | +leap_none+    | normal synchronized state
| +1+  | +leap_add_sec+ | insert second after 23:59:59 of the current day
| +2+  | +leap_del_sec+ | delete second 23:59:59 of the current day
| +3+  | +leap_alarm+   | never synchronized
|========================================================================

The Source Field displays the current synchronization source coded as
follows:

[width="70%",cols=">10%,<30%,<60%",]
|=============================================================================
| Code  | Message          | Description
| +0+   | +sync_unspec+    | not yet synchronized

| +9+   | +sync_telephone+ | telephone modem (ACTS, PTB, etc.)
|=============================================================================

The Count Field displays the number of events since the last time the
code changed. Upon reaching 15, subsequent events with the same code are
ignored.

The Event Field displays the most recent event message coded as follows:

[width="70%",cols=">10%,<30%,<60%",]
|============================================================================
| Code  | Message                   | Description

|============================================================================

[[peer]]
== Peer Status Word ==

The peer status word consists of four fields: Status (0-4), Select
(5-7), Count (8-11) and Code (12-15). It is reported in the first line
of the +rv associd+ display produced by the +{ntpq}+ program.

[width="50%"]
|===============================
| Status | Select | Count | Code
|===============================

The Status Field displays the peer status code bits in hexadecimal; each
bit is an independent flag. (Note this field is 5 bits wide, and
combines with the 3-bit-wide Select Field to create the first full
byte of the peer status word.) The meaning of each bit in the Status
Field is listed in the following table:

[width="70%",cols=">10%,<30%,<60%",]
|==============================================================
| Code | Message   | Description
| +08+ | +bcst+    | broadcast association
| +10+ | +reach+   | host reachable
| +20+ | +auth+    | authentication ok
| +40+ | +authenb+ | authentication enabled
| +80+ | +config+  | persistent association
|==============================================================

The Select Field displays the current selection status. (The T Field in
the following table gives the corresponding tally codes used in the
+{ntpq} peers+ display.) The values are coded as follows:

[width="70%",cols=">10%,<25%,^10%,<55%",]
|============================================================================
| Code| Message         | T   | Description
| +0+ | +sel_reject+    |     | discarded as not valid (TEST10-TEST13)
| +1+ | +sel_falsetick+ | +x+ | discarded by intersection algorithm
| +2+ | +sel_excess+    | +.+ | discarded by table overflow (not used)
| +3+ | +sel_outlier+   | +-+ | discarded by the cluster algorithm
| +4+ | +sel_candidate+ | +++ | included by the combine algorithm
| +5+ | +sel_backup+    | +#+ | backup (more than +tos maxclock+ sources)
| +6+ | +sel_sys.peer+  | +*+ | system peer
| +7+ | +sel_pps.peer+  | +o+ | PPS peer (when the prefer peer is valid)
|=============================================================================

The Count Field displays the number of events since the last time the
code changed. Upon reaching 15, subsequent events with the same code are
ignored.

The Event Field displays the most recent event message coded as follows:

[width="70%",cols=">10%,<30%,<60%",]
|============================================================================
| Code | Message            | Description
| +01+ | +mobilize+         | association mobilized

| +0c+ | +bad_auth+         | authentication failure
| +0d+ | +popcorn+          | popcorn spike suppressor
|============================================================================

[[clock]]
== Clock Status Word ==

The clock status word consists of four fields: Unused (0-7), Count
(8-11) and Code (12-15). It is reported in the first line of the
+clockvar associd+ display produced by the +{ntpq}+ program.

[width="50%"]
|=========================
| Unused | Count | Code
|=========================

The Count Field displays the number of events since the last +lockvar+
command, while the Event Field displays the most recent event message
coded as follows:

[width="70%",cols=">10%,<30%,<60%",]
|===========================================================================
| Code | Message            | Description
| +00+ | +clk_unspec+        | nominal
| +01+ | +clk_noreply+      | no reply to poll
| +02+ | +clk_badformat+    | bad timecode format
| +03+ | +clk_fault+        | hardware or software fault
| +04+ | +clk_bad_signal+   | signal loss
| +05+ | +clk_bad_date+     | bad date format
| +06+ | +clk_bad_time+     | bad time format
|===========================================================================

When the clock driver sets the code to a new value, a +clock_alarm+ (11)
peer event is reported.

[[flash]]
== Flash Status Word ==

The flash status word is displayed by the +{ntpq}+ program +rv+ command.
It consists of a number of bits coded in hexadecimal as follows:

[width="70%",cols=">10%,<15%,<25%,<50%",]
|==============================================================================
| Code   | Tag     | Message        | Description
| +0001+ | BOGON1  | +pkt_dup+      | duplicate packet
| +0002+ | BOGON2  | +pkt_bogus+    | bogus packet
| +0004+ | BOGON3  | +pkt_unsync+   | server not synchronized
| +0008+ | BOGON4  | +pkt_denied+   | access denied
| +0010+ | BOGON5  | +pkt_auth+     | authentication failure
| +0020+ | BOGON6  | +pkt_stratum+  | invalid leap or stratum
| +0040+ | BOGON7  | +pkt_header+   | header distance exceeded

| +0800+ | BOGON12 | +peer_loop+    | synchronization loop
| +1000+ | BOGON13 | +peer_unreach+ | unreachable or nonselect
|==============================================================================

The "Tag" field is the name the source code uses for the status bit.
Not all bits are in use, but have been kept for backwards compatibility. 

[[kiss]]
== Kiss Codes ==

Kiss codes are used in kiss-o'-death (KoD) packets, billboard displays
and log messages. They consist of a string of four zero-padded ASCII
charactes. In practice they are informal and tend to change with time
and implementation. Some of these codes can appear in the reference
identifier field in +{ntpq}+ billboards. Following is the current list:

[width="50%",cols=">20%,<80%"]
|==================================================================
| Code   | Description
| +ACST+ | manycast server
| +AUTH+ | authentication error
| +BCST+ | broadcast server
| +DENY+ | access denied by server
| +INIT+ | association initialized
| +MCST+ | multicast server
| +RATE+ | rate exceeded
| +TIME+ | association timeout
| +STEP+ | step time change
