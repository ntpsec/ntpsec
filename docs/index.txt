[[intro]]
== Introduction ==

The Network Time Protocol software contained in this
distribution is available without charge under the conditions set
forth in the link:copyright.html[Copyright Notice].

[NOTE]
It is very important that readers understand that the NTP document
collection began 25 years ago and remains today a work in progress. It
has evolved as new features were invented and old features retired. It
has been widely copied, cached and morphed to other formats, including
man pages, with varying loss of fidelity. However, these HTML pages are
the ONLY authoritative and definitive reference. Readers should always
use the collection that comes with the distribution they use. A copy of
the online collection at {project-weblink} is normally included in the most
recent snapshot, but might not agree with an earlier snapshot or
release version.

This distribution is an implementation of RFC-5905 "Network Time
Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification".  NTP is
widely used to synchronize a computer to Internet time servers or
other sources, such as a radio or satellite receiver or telephone
modem service. It can also be used as a server for dependent
clients. It provides accuracies typically less than a millisecond on
LANs and up to a few tens of milliseconds on WANs. Typical NTP
configurations utilize multiple redundant servers and diverse network
paths in order to achieve high accuracy and reliability.

For background on the problems NTP solves, see
link:http://www.catb.org/gpsd/time-service-intro.html[Introduction to
Time Service].  This white paper discusses time source types, relative
accuracy, relative cost, and how those figures of merit have changed
in recent decades

The link:ntpspeak.html[Glossary of NTP-speak] might also be a helpful
guide for the perplexed.

[[differences]]
== Differences from NTP Classic ==

The design objectives of this distribution, {project-fullname}, are in
many ways a break with NTP's past.  We have deliberately jettisoned
support for ancient legacy hardware and operating systems in order to
ship code that is security-hardened, simpler, drastically less bulky
(the KLOC count of the suite has been cut by more than a factor of
two!), easier to understand, and easier to maintain.

We retain, however, almost full compatibility and interoperation with
NTP Classic.  The qualification "almost" is required because we do not
support the Autokey public-key encryption scheme. It had
interoperability and exploitable vulnerability issues too severe to
be patched. It will need redesign and reimplementation before it
can be fielded again.

This project began as an effort to address serious security issues
with NTP Classic, and we intend to keep a particularly strong focus on
code security and code verifiability.

Most of the changes are under the hood, internal to the codebase.  A
few will be user-visible:

* The documentation has been extensively updated and revised.  One
  important change is that manual pages are now generated from the
  same masters as this web documentation, so the two will no longer
  drift out of synchronization.  

* Internally, there is more consistent use of nanosecond precision.
  A visible effect of this is that time stepping with sufficiently
  high-precision time sources could be accurate down to nanoseconds
  rather than microseconds; this might actually matter for GPSDOs
  and high-quality radio clocks.

* The deprecated ntpdc utility, long since replaced by {ntpq}, has been removed.

* The ntpsnmpd daemon, incomplete and not conformant with RFC 5907,
  has been removed.

* A number of obsolete refclocks have been removed.

* The +sntp+ program has been renamed +{ntpdig}+ in order to make
  NTP installables have a uniform name prefix and take up less
  namespace. Also, +ntp-keygen+ is now +{ntpkeygen}+, +ntp-wait+
  is {ntpwait}, and +update-leap+ is now +ntpleapfetch+.

* A new utility, {ntpfrob}, collects several small diagnostic functions
  for reading and tweaking the local clock hardware, including reading
  the clock tick rate, precision, and jitter. Part of it formerly
  traveled as +tickadj+.

* The deprecated ntpdate program has been replaced with a shell
  wrapper around {ntpdig}.

* Log timestamps look a little different; they are now in ISO8601 format.

* As noted above, Autokey is not supported.

[[platforms]]
== Supported platforms ==

{project-shortname} supports all operating systems conforming to
POSIX.1-2001 and ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (aka C99).  Primary platforms
include Linux and the *BSD family; any reasonably modern proprietary
Unix will also serve

If you have a requirement for time service on an OS we don't support,
and its API is reasonably close to our POSIX/C99 conformance baseline,
we'll try to meet you halfway. We're open to development partnerships
with individuals and organizations who have special needs and can
contribute either engineering time or money to meet our costs of
development; our only hard condition is that all joint results must be
redistributable as open source.

[[hand]]
== The Handbook ==

A good deal of tutorial and directive information is available on the
handbook pages. These should be read in conjunction with the command and
option information available on the pages listed on the sitemap page.

link:assoc.html[Association Management]::
  Describes how to configure servers and peers and manage the various
  options. Includes automatic server discovery schemes.
link:discover.html[Automatic Server Discovery Schemes]::
  Describes automatic server discovery using broadcast, multicast,
  manycast and server pool scheme.
link:access.html[Access Control Support]::
  Describes the access control mechanisms that can be used to limit
  client access to various time and management functions.
link:authentic.html[Authentication Support]::
  Describes the authentication mechanisms for symmetric-key and
  public-key cryptography.
link:rate.html[Rate Management]::
  Describes the principles of rate management to minimize network load
  and defend against DoS attacks.
link:refclock.html[Reference Clock Support]::
  Describes the collection of clocks and devices used to synchronize primary
  servers.
link:warp.html[How NTP Works]::
  Gives an overview of the NTP daemon architecture and how it works.

[[build]]
== Building and Installing NTP ==

The link:build.html[Building and Installing the Distribution] page
gives and overview of the procedures for building and installing
on a typical system.  For more details, see the INSTALL file in the
distribution root.

[[prob]]
== Resolving Problems ==

Like other things in modern Internet life, NTP problems can be
devilishly intricate. This distribution includes a number of utilities
designed to identify and repair problems using an integrated management
protocol supported by the link:ntpq.html[+{ntpq}+] utility program.

The link:debug.html[NTP Debugging Techniques] and link:hints.html[Hints
and Kinks] pages contain useful information for identifying problems and
devising solutions. Additional information on reference clock driver
construction and debugging is in the link:rdebug.html[Debugging Hints
for Reference Clock Drivers] page.

Users are invited to report bugs and offer suggestions via the
link:bugs.html[NTP Bug Reporting Procedures] page.

[[info]]
== Further Information ==

The link:sitemap.html[Site Map] page contains a list of document
collections arranged by topic. The Program Manual Pages collection may
be the best place to start. The link:comdex.html[Command Index]
collection contains a list of all configuration file commands together
with a short function description. There is a
link:ntpspeak.html[glossary of NTP-speak]. A great wealth of
additional information is available via the External Links collection,
including a book and numerous background papers and briefing
presentations.

Background information on computer network time synchronization is on
the {millshome}exec.html[Executive Summary -
Computer Network Time Synchronization] page. Background information,
bibliography and briefing slides suitable for presentations are on the
{millshome}ntp.html[Network Time
Synchronization Research Project] page. Additional information is at
the {project-shortname} web site {project-weblink}.
