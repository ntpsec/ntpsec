[[intro]]
== Introduction ==

Note: The Network Time Protocol software contained in this
distribution is available without charge under the conditions set
forth in the link:copyright.html[Copyright Notice].

[NOTE]
It is very important that readers understand that the NTP document
collection began 25 years ago and remains today a work in progress. It
has evolved as new features were invented and old features retired. It
has been widely copied, cached and morphed to other formats, including
man pages, with varying loss of fidelity. However, these HTML pages are
the ONLY authoritative and definitive reference. Readers should always
use the collection that comes with the distribution they use. A copy of
the online collection at {project-weblink} is normally included in the most
recent snapshot, but might not agree with an earlier snapshot or
release version.

This distribution is an implementation of RFC-5905 "Network Time
Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification".  NTP is
widely used to synchronize a computer to Internet time servers or
other sources, such as a radio or satellite receiver or telephone
modem service. It can also be used as a server for dependent
clients. It provides accuracies typically less than a millisecond on
LANs and up to a few milliseconds on WANs. Typical NTP configurations
utilize multiple redundant servers and diverse network paths in order
to achieve high accuracy and reliability.

[[differences]]
== Differences from NTP Classic ==

The design objectives of this distribution, {project-fullname}, are in
many ways a break with NTP's past.  We have deliberately jettisoned
support for ancient legacy hardware and operating systems in order to
ship code that is security-hardened, simpler, drastically less bulky
(the KLOC count of the suite has been cut by a factor of two!), easier
to understand, and easier to maintain.

This project began as an effort to address serious security issues
with NTP Classic, and we intend to keep a particularly strong focus on
code security and code verifiability.

Most of the changes are under the hood, internal to the codebase.  A
few will be user-visible:

* The documentation has been extensively updated and revised.

* The ntpdc utility, long since replaced by ntpq, has been removed.

* A number of obsolete refclocks have been removed.

[[platforms]]
== Supported platforms ==

{project-shortname} supports all operating systems conforming to
POSIX.1-2001 and ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (aka C99).  Primary platforms
include Linux and the *BSD family; any reasonably modern proprietary
Unix will also serve

If you have a requirement for time service on an OS we don't support,
and its API is reasonably close to our POSIX/C99 conformance baseline,
we'll try to meet you halfway. We're open to development partnerships
with individuals and organizations who have special needs and can
contribute either engineering time or money to meet our costs of
development; our only hard condition is that all joint results must be
redistributable as open source.

[[hand]]
== The Handbook ==

A good deal of tutorial and directive information is available on the
handbook pages. These should be read in conjunction with the command and
option information available on the pages listed on the sitemap page.

link:release.html[NTP Version 4 Release Notes]::
  Lists recent changes and new features in the current distribution.
link:assoc.html[Association Management]::
  Describes how to configure servers and peers and manage the various
  options. Includes automatic server discovery schemes.
link:discover.html[Automatic Server Discovery Schemes]::
  Describes automatic server discovery using broadcast, multicast,
  manycast and server pool scheme.
link:access.html[Access Control Support]::
  Describes the access control mechanisms that can be used to limit
  client access to various time and management functions.
link:authentic.html[Authentication Support]::
  Describes the authentication mechanisms for symmetric-key and
  public-key cryptography.
link:rate.html[Rate Management]::
  Describes the principles of rate management to minimize network load
  and defend against DoS attacks.
link:refclock.html[Reference Clock Support]::
  Describes the collection of radio clocks used to synchronize primary
  servers.
link:warp.html[How NTP Works]::
  Gives an overview of the NTP daemon architecture and how it works.

[[build]]
== Building and Installing NTP ==

The link:build.html[Building and Installing the Distribution] page
gives and overview of the procedures for building and installing
on a typical system.  For more details, see the INSTALL file in the
distribution root.

[[prob]]
== Resolving Problems ==

Like other things in modern Internet life, NTP problems can be
devilishly intricate. This distribution includes a number of utilities
designed to identify and repair problems using an integrated management
protocol supported by the link:ntpq.html[`ntpq`] utility program.

The link:debug.html[NTP Debugging Techniques] and link:hints.html[Hints
and Kinks] pages contain useful information for identifying problems and
devising solutions. Additional information on reference clock driver
construction and debugging is in the link:rdebug.html[Debugging Hints
for Reference Clock Drivers] page.

Users are invited to report bugs and offer suggestions via the
link:bugs.html[NTP Bug Reporting Procedures] page.

[[info]]
== Further Information ==

The link:sitemap.html[Site Map] page contains a list of document
collections arranged by topic. The Program Manual Pages collection may
be the best place to start. The link:comdex.html[Command Index]
collection contains a list of all configuration file commands together
with a short function description. A great wealth of additional
information is available via the External Links collection, including a
book and numerous background papers and briefing presentations.

Background information on computer network time synchronization is on
the http://www.eecis.udel.edu/%7emills/exec.html[Executive Summary -
Computer Network Time Synchronization] page. Discussion on new features
and interoperability with previous NTP versions is on the
link:release.html[NTP Version 4 Release Notes] page. Background
information, bibliography and briefing slides suitable for presentations
are on the http://www.eecis.udel.edu/%7emills/ntp.html[Network Time
Synchronization Research Project] page. Additional information is at the
{project-shortname} web site {project-weblink}.
