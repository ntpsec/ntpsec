["literal",subs="normal"]

== Deprecation warning ==

This refclock is deprecated and obsolete. The {project-shortname}

== Description ==

This driver supports the Forum Graphic GPS Dating station sold by
http://www.emr.fr/gpsclock.html[EMR company].

Unfortunately sometime FG GPS start continues reporting of the same
date. The only way to fix this problem is GPS power cycling and ntpd
restart after GPS power-up.

After Jan,10 2000 my FG GPS unit start send a wrong answer after 10:00am
till 11:00am. It repeat hour value in result string twice. I wroite a
small code to avoid such problem. Unfortunately I have no second FG GPS
unit to evaluate this problem. Please let me know if your GPS has no
problems after Y2K.
