== Older SCO Unix versions ==

NTP 4.0.x does not run on SCO Unix prior to version 3.2.5.0.0. If you
need NTP on an older SCO Unix system and don't mind to modify your
kernel, use 3.5.91 which has patches for SCO Unix 3.2.4.x. Apply the
kernel modifications as described in
http://www.echelon.nl/en/ntp/sco3-recipe.html[XNTP on SCO 3.2.4.2].

== Compiling NTP ==

Delete the old SCO supplied NTP programs using the "custom" utility. Run
the NTP configure program with CFLAGS="-b elf -K _processor-type_" for
best results.

== Running NTP ==

Run "tickadj -As" after every reboot to set the variables "clock_drift"
and "track_rtc" to the right values.

Run "ntpd" with a high negative nice-value, i.e. "nice --19 ntpd" for
best results.

== More information ==

More information on the way SCO Unix and NTP interact can be found in
http://www.echelon.nl/en/ntp/ntp-on-sco.html[NTP on SCO Unix], which
includes links to precompiled versions of NTP.
