= NTP 4.x for Windows =

== Introduction ==

The NTP 4 distribution runs as service on Windows 2000 and later. It
will NOT run on Windows 95, 98, ME, etc. Lately it has been run the most
on Windows-7 and later. The binaries work on multi-processor systems.
This port has not been tested on the Alpha platform. This release now
uses OpenSSL for authentication. IPv6 is not implemented yet for Win32
platforms. A ready-to-run install distribution is available from
Meinberg at
http://www.meinberg.de/english/sw/ntp.htm[http://www.meinberg.de/english/sw/ntp.htm.]

Users should note that the stock Windows client sends requests as mode-1
packets, which can have unintended consequences and create a security
risk. The client should send requests as mode-3 (client) packets, which
conform to the protocol specification. The issues and resolution are
described in Microsoft KB 875424. A less desirable alternative that
avoids changing registry keys is to use the `--with-wintime` option when
building the executable.

== Authentication Keys ==

With this release ntp-keygen is supported. See the
link:../keygen.html[ntp keygen documentation] for details on how to use
ntp-keygen.

`ntpd` can now use the generated keys in the same way as on Unix
platforms. Please refer to the link:../authopt.html[Authentication
Options] for details on how to use these.

*NOTE:* ntpd and `ntp-keygen` both use OpenSSL which requires a random
character file called `.rnd` by default. Both of these programs will
automatically generate this file if they are not found. The programs
will look for an environmental variable called RANDFILE and use that for
the name of the random character file if the variable exists. If it does
not exist it will look for an environmental variable called HOME and use
that directory to search for a file called `.rnd` in that directory.
Finally, if neither RANDFILE nor HOME exists it will look in `C:\` for a
.rnd file. In each case it will search for and create the file if the
environmental variable exists or in the C:\ directory if it doesn't.

Note that ntpd normally runs as a service so that the only way that it
will have either RANDFILE or HOME defined is if it is a System
environmental variable or if the service is run under a specific account
name and that account has one of those variables defined. Otherwise it
will use the file `c:\.rnd`. This was done so that OpenSSL will work
normally on Win32 systems. This obviates the need to ship the
OpenSSL.exe file and explain how to generate the .rnd file. A future
version may change this behavior.

Refer to link:#Compiling[Compiling Requirements] and Instructions for
how to compile the program.

== Reference Clocks ==

Reference clock support under Windows NT is tricky because the IO
functions are so much different. Some of the clock types have been built
into the ntpd executable and should work but have not been tested by the
ntp project. If you have a clock that runs on Win32 and the driver is
there but not implemented on Win32 you will have make the required
configuration changes in config.h and then build ntpd from source and
test it. The following reference clock is known to work and is supported
by Windows NT: link:../drivers/driver1.html[Type 1] Undisciplined Local
Clock (LOCAL)

== Functions Supported ==

All NTP functions are supported with some constraints. See the
link:#ToDo[TODO list] below. Note that the ntptrace executable is not
supported and you should use the PERL script version instead.

== Accuracy ==

Greg Brackley has implemented a fantastic interpolation scheme that
improves the precision of the NTP clock using a realtime thread (is that
poetic or what!) which captures a tick count from the 8253 counter after
each OS tick. The count is used to interpolate the time between
operating system ticks.

On a typical 200+ MHz system NTP achieves a precision of about 5
microseconds and synchronizes the clock to +/-500 microseconds using the
http://www.trimble.com/products/ntp[Trimble Palisade] as UTC reference.
This allows distributed applications to use the 10 milliseconds ticks
available to them with high confidence.

== Binaries ==

Recent InstallShield based executable versions of NTP for Windows NT
(intel) are available from:

* http://www.five-ten-sg.com/

[[ToDo]]
== ToDo ==

These tasks are in no particular order of priority.

* Add IPv6 support
* See if precision can be improved by using CPU cycle counter for tick
interpolation.
* Make precision time available to applications using NTP_GETTIME API

== Compiling Requirements ==

* Windows 7 or Windows.NET Server 2003, or later.
* Windows NT 4.0 Windows 2000, Windows XP or Windows Vista _may_ still
work.
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2008, 2010, or 2013 EE
* Some way of uncompressing and untarring the gzipped tar file.
* OpenSSL must be built on the box before building NTP. Additional steps
would be required to not use OpenSSL.
* Microsoft Visual C++ redistributables

*Compiling Instructions*

1.  Install Micosoft Visual C++
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9B2DA534-3E03-4391-8A4D-074B9F2BC1BF[redistributables]
2.  Install http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html[OpenSSL
full installer for Windows]. Add the following to your system
environment variables in the control panel (adjusting paths as
appropriate to point to the directory containing only an openssl
subdirectory, for OPENSSL_INC, and to the directory containing openssl
.lib files for OPENSSL_LIB:
* OPENSSL_INC=C:\OpenSSL\include
* OPENSSL_LIB=C:\OpenSSL\lib
3.  Unpack the NTP-4.x.tar.gz using utilities such as WinZip or WinRar.
4.  Run Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 EE.
5.  Open the ports\winnt\vs2008\ntp.sln solution file
6.  Batch build all projects (Build menu, Batch Build..., select all,
build).
7.  The built binaries can be found in the
`ports\winnt\v2008\Win32-bin\Release` directory.
8.  If you are shipping binaries in a kit it is strongly recommended
that you ship this file (winnt.html) along with the binaries.

== Configuration File ==

The default NTP configuration file path is
%SystemRoot%`\system32\drivers\etc\. `(%SystemRoot% is an environmental
variable that can be determined by typing "set" at the "Command Prompt"
or from the "System" icon in the "Control Panel").

Refer to your system environment and create your` ntp.conf` file in the
directory corresponding to your system  installation. The older
`<WINDIR>\ntp.conf` is still supported but you will get a log entry
reporting that the first file wasn't found.

== Installation Instructions ==

The `instsrv` program in the instsrv subdirectory of the distribution
can be used to install 'ntpd' as a service and start automatically at
boot time. Instsrv is automatically compiled with the rest of the
distribution if you followed the steps above.

1.  Start a command prompt and enter "instsrv.exe
<pathname_for_ntpd.exe>"
2.  Clicking on the "Services" icon in the "Control Panel" will display
the list of currently installed services in a dialog box. The
NetworkTimeProtocol service should show up in this list. Select it in
the list and hit the "Start" button in the dialog box. The NTP service
should start.
3.  You can also stop and start the service by typing net start|stop
NetworkTimeProtocol at the DOS prompt.
4.  View the event log by clicking on the "Event Viewer" icon in the
"Administrative Tools" group, there should be several successful startup
messages from NTP. NTP will keep running and restart automatically when
the machine is rebooted.

You can change the start mode (automatic/manual) and other startup
parameters corresponding to the NTP service in the "Services" dialog box
if you wish.

== Removing NTP ==

You can also use `instsrv` to delete the NTP service by entering:
`>"instsrv.exe remove"`

== Command Line Parameters and Registry Entries ==

Unlike the Unix environment, there is no clean way to run 'ntpdate' and
reset the clock before starting 'ntpd' at boot time. NTP will step the
clock up to 1000 seconds by default. While there is no reason that the
system clock should be that much off during bootup if `ntpd` was running
before, you may wish to override this default and/or pass other command
line directives.

Use the registry editor to edit the value for the ntpd executable under
LocalMachine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTP.

Add the -g option to the ImagePath key, behind "%INSTALLDIR>\ntpd.exe".
This will force NTP to accept large time errors (including 1.1.1980
00:00)
