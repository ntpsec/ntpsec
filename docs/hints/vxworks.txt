== VxWorks port of NTP ==

Last update: 21-Oct-2010 23:44 UTC

Creating a port for vxWorks posed some problems. This port may help as a
starting point for similar ports to real-time OS's and other embeddable
kernels, particularly where `main()` is not allowed, and where the
configure scripts need to be altered.

== Configuration issues ==

I decided to do as little invasive surgery as possible on the NTP code,
so I brought the vxWorks header tree in line with the standard Unix
tree. The following changes were needed, as a side effect these changes
will allow for easy porting of other autoconfigure enabled code.

Where I have 386 you will need to put in your target type. The vxWorks
tree entry point is `/usr/wind`. If these are the same for your system,
you should be able to cut and paste the changes.

WARNING: Check you are not overwriting files, before entering the
following: there should be no conflict, but check first...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            export CC="cc386 -nostdlib -m486 -DCPU=I80486 -I/usr/wind/target/h"
            export RANLIB=ranlib386
            export AR=ar386
            export VX_KERNEL=/usr/wind/target/config/ims_std_bsp/vxWorks
            
            cd /usr/wind/target/sys
            ln -s ../signal.h
            ln -s ../time.h
            ln -s socket.h sockio.h
            ln -s ../selectLib.h select.h
            ln -s ../timers.h
            touch file.h param.h resource.h utsname.h var.h ../netdb.h ../a.out.h ../termios.h
         echo " ******ADD #include \"sys/times.h\" to sys/time.h "
            
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The configure script must be changed in the following way to get the
linking tests to work, once in the correct directory issue the following
commands:

---------------------------------------------------------------
      sed -e 's%main.*()%vxmain()%' configure > configure.vxnew
            mv configure.vxnew configure
            chmod 755 configure
      
---------------------------------------------------------------

The new version 4 of NTP requires some maths functions so it links in
the maths library (-lm) in the `./ntpd/Makefile.am` file change the line
`ntpd_LDADD = $(LDADD) -lm` by removing the "-lm".

>You are now ready to compile

The ./configure.in file needed to be altered to allow for a host-target
configuration to take place.

* The define SYS_VXWORKS was added to the compilation flags.
* Little endianess is set if the target is of type iX86.
* The size of char, integer, long values are all set. If Wind River ever
changes these values they will need to be updated.
* clock_settime() is defined to be used for setting the clock.
* The Linking flags have -r added to allow for relinking into the
vxWorks kernel

Unfortunately I have had to make use of the `./include/ntp_machine.h`
file to add in the checks that would have been checked at linking stage
by `autoconf`, a better method should be devised.

* There is now a `NO_MAIN_ALLOWED` define that simulates command line
args, this allows the use of the normal startup sysntax.
* POSIX timers have been added.
* Structures normally found in `netdb.h` have been added with, the
corresponding code is in `./libntp/machines.c`. Where possible the
defines for these have been kept non-vxWorks specific.

Unfortunately there are still quite a few `SYS_VXWORKS` type defines in
the source, but I have eliminated as many as possible. You have the
choice of using the `usrtime.a` library avaliable from the vxworks
archives or forgoing `adjtime()` and using the `clock_[get|set]time()`.
The `./include/ntp_machine.h` file clearly marks how to do this.

== Compilation issues ==

You will need autoconf and automake ... available free from the gnu
archives worldwide.

The variable `arch` is the target architecture (e.g. i486)

--------------------------------------------------
            mkdir A.vxworks)
            cd A.vxworks
            ../configure --target=arch-wrs-vxworks
            make
       
--------------------------------------------------

Options I normally use are the
`--disable-all-clocks --enable-LOCAL-CLOCK` flags. The program should
proceed to compile without problem. The daemon ntpd, ntpdate, ntptrace,
ntpdc, ntpq programs and of course the libraries are all fully ported.
The other utilities are not, but they should be easy to port.

== Running the software ==

Load in the various files, call them in the normal vxWorks function type
manner. Here are some examples. Refer to the man pages for further
information.

-------------------------------------------------------------
            ld < ntpdate/ntpdate
            ld < ntpd/ntpd
            ld < ntptrace/ntptrace
            ld < ntpq/ntpq
            ld < ntpdc/ntpdc
            ntpdate ("-b", "192.168.0.245")
            sp(ntpd, "-c", "/export/home/casey/ntp/ntp.conf")
            ntpdc("-c", "monlist", "192.168.0.244")
            ntpq("-c", "peers", "192.168.0.244")
            ntptrace("192.168.0.244")
