Address: 127.127.20._u_
Reference ID: GPS

== Description ==

This driver supports GPS receivers with the +$GPRMC+, +$GPGLL+,
+$GPGGA+, +$GPZDA+ and +$GPZDG+ NMEA sentences by default.  Note that
Accord's custom NMEA sentence +$GPZDG+ reports using the GPS timescale,
while the rest of the sentences report UTC.  The difference between the
two is a whole number of seconds which increases with each leap second
insertion in UTC.  To avoid problems mixing UTC and GPS timescales, the
driver disables processing of UTC sentences once +$GPZDG+ is received.

The driver expects the receiver to be set up to transmit at least one
supported sentence every second.

The accuracy depends on the receiver used. Inexpensive GPS models are
available with a claimed PPS signal accuracy of 1 &mu;s or better relative
to the broadcast signal. However, in most cases the actual accuracy is
limited by the precision of the timecode and the latencies of the serial
interface and operating system.

If the operating system supports PPSAPI
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2783.txt[RFC 2783]), fudge flag1 1 enables
its use.

If there is a /dev/gpspps__u__ it is tried first for PPS, before /dev/gps__u__.

The various GPS sentences that this driver recognises look like this:

|=============================================================================


The default (mode 0) is to process all supported sentences at a
linespeed of 4800 bps, which results in the first one received and
recognized in each cycle being used.  If only specific sentences should
be recognized, then the mode byte must be chosen to enable only the
selected ones.  Multiple sentences may be selected by adding their mode
bit values, but of those enabled still only the first received sentence
in a cycle will be used.  Using more than one sentence per cycle is
impossible, because

* there is only link:#fudgetime2[fudge time2] available to compensate
for transmission delays but every sentence would need a different one
and
* using more than one sentence per cycle overstuffs the internal data
filters.

The driver uses 4800 bits per second by default, but faster bitrates can
be selected using bits 4 to 6 of the mode field.

*Caveat:* Using higher line speeds does not necessarily increase the
precision of the timing device.  Higher line speeds are not necessarily
helpful for the NMEA driver, either.  They can be used to accommodate
an amount of data that does not fit into a 1-second cycle at 4800 bps,
but high-speed high-volume NMEA data is likely to cause trouble with the
serial line driver since NMEA supports no protocol handshake.  Any
device that is exclusively used for time synchronisation purposes should
be configured to transmit the relevant data only, e.g. one +$GPRMC+ or
+$GPZDA+ per second, at a linespeed of 4800 bps or 9600 bps.

== Monitor Data ==

The last GPS sentence that is accepted or rejected is written to the
clockstats file and available with +{ntpq} -c clockvar+. (Logging the
rejected sentences lets you see/debug why they were rejected.) Filtered
sentences are not logged.

If the 0x10000 mode bit is on and clockstats is enabled, several extra
counters will be appended to the NMEA sentence that gets logged. For
example:

Sentences like $GPGSV that don't contain the time will get counted in
the total but otherwise ignored.

http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/ConfiguringNMEARefclocks[Configuring
NMEA Refclocks] might give further useful hints for specific hardware
devices that exhibit strange or curious behaviour.

To make a specific setting, select the corresponding decimal values from
the mode byte table, add them all together and enter the resulting
decimal value into the clock configuration line.

Now switch only $GPRMC on by sending it the following string.

On some systems the PPS signal isn't switched on by default. It can be
switched on by sending the following string.
