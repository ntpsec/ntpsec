= Austron 2200A/2201A GPS Receivers =

== Synopsis ==

["verse",subs="normal"]
Name: austron
Reference ID: GPS
Serial Port: /dev/gps__u__; 9600bps 8N1
Features: +tty_clk+

== Deprecation warning ==

This refclock is deprecated and obsolete. The {project-shortname}
maintainers plan to remove it in a future release.  If you have a
requirement for it, please make this known to us.

== Description ==

This driver supports the Austron 2200A/2201A GPS/LORAN Synchronized
Clock and Timing Receiver connected via a serial port. It supports
several special features of the clock, including the Input Buffer
Module, Output Buffer Module, IRIG-B Interface Module and LORAN Assist
Module. It requires the RS232 Buffered Serial Interface module for
communication with the driver.

This receiver is capable of a comprehensive and large volume of
statistics and operational data. The specific data collection commands
and attributes are embedded in the driver source code; however, the
collection process can be enabled or disabled using the flag4 flag. If
set, collection is enabled; if not, which is the default, it is
disabled. A comprehensive suite of data reduction and summary scripts is
in the ./scripts/stats directory of the distribution.

== Monitor Data ==

When enabled by the +flag4+ option, every received timecode is
written as-is to the +clockstats+ file.
