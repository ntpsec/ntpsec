[[address]]
== Server and Peer Addresses ==

Following is a description of the server configuration commands in
NTPv4. There are two classes of commands, configuration commands that
configure an association with a remote server, peer or reference clock,
and auxiliary commands that specify environment variables that control
various related operations.

The various modes described on the link:assoc.html[Association
Management] page are determined by the command keyword and the DNS
name or IP address. Addresses are classed by type as (s) a remote
server or peer (IPv4 class A, B and C or IPv6), or (b) the IPv4 broadcast
address of a local interface.

If the Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6 (RFC 2553) is
detected, support for the IPv6 address family is generated in addition
to the default IPv4 address family. IPv6 addresses can be identified by
the presence of colons ":" in the address field. IPv6 addresses can be
used almost everywhere where IPv4 addresses can be used, with the
exception of reference clock addresses, which are always IPv4. Note that
in contexts where a host name is expected, a +-4+ qualifier preceding
the host name forces DNS resolution to the IPv4 namespace, while a
+-6+ qualifier forces DNS resolution to the IPv6 namespace.

[[association]]
== Association Commands ==

Unless noted otherwise, further information about these commands is at
link:discover.html#pool[Automatic Server Discovery].

The http://www.pool.ntp.org/[www.pool.ntp.org] page describes a
compatible pool of public NTP servers, which are probably what you
want to define associations with unless you specifically know
otherwise.
