If you find or suspect a security related program bug in this
distribution, please send a report to {project-security-list}. Please do not
contact developers directly.

== Non-Security Bug Reporting Procedures ==

If you find or suspect a non-security related program or documentation
bug in this distribution, please enter a report on the project's
{project-issuetracker}[issue tracker]. Bugs reported this way are
immediately forwarded to the developers. Please do not contact the
developers directly.

If you wish to send a report via electronic mail, please remember that
your report will be held until one of our volunteers enters it in
the project's issue tracker. The email address for these reports is
{project-bug-list}. You will need to join the bugs list to
participate directly in any e-mail discussion regarding your
report. If you don't register and we have questions for you we won't
be able to make progress on fixing your problem. Please directly
register on and use our bugtracker instance to report issues.
