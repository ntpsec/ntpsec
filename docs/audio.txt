[[deprecation]]
== Deprecation note ==

As of 2015 the technologies descried on this page are obsolete and the
{project-shortname} maintainers no longer recommend them.  Compared to
an inexpensive GPS with 1PPS capability, audio time is both
substantially less accurate and less reliably available, for reasons
ranging from longer atmospheric path to intrinsic jitter in the
receiving devices.  Reflecting this, no precision time radios have been
manufactured in the U.S. since NIST's incompatible WWV modulation
change in 2013.

Audio drivers for the NIST time stations WWV and WWVH have already
been removed from the distribution because they pre-dated the 2013
modulation change.  The remaining CHU and IRIG drivers are a
significant maintainance problem, are deprecated, and are likely to be
removed in a future release unless a significant user constituency for
them makes itself known.

[[sound]]
== Sound Card Drivers ==

There are some applications in which the computer time can be
disciplined to an audio signal, rather than a serial timecode and
communications port or special purpose bus peripheral. This is useful in
such cases where the audio signal is sent over a telephone circuit, for
example, or received directly from a shortwave receiver. In such cases
the audio signal can be connected via an ordinary sound card or
baseboard audio codec.

The suite of NTP reference clock drivers currently includes two
drivers suitable for these applications. They include a driver for the
Inter Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) signals produced by many
radio clocks and timing devices, and another for the Canadian
time/frequency radio station CHU.  There was formerly a third audio
driver for the NIST time & frequency radio stations WWV and WWVH, but
it was obsolesced by the 2013 modulation change and has been removed.

These drivers make ample use of sophisticated digital signal
processing algorithms designed to efficiently extract timing signals
from noise and interference. The radio station driver in particular
implements optimum linear demodulation and decoding techniques, including
maximum-likelihood and soft-decision methods. The documentation page for
each driver contains an in-depth discussion on the algorithms and
performance expectations. In some cases the algorithms are further
analyzed, modeled and evaluated in a technical report.

Currently, the audio drivers work with with Sun operating systems and
audio codecs, including SunOS 4.1.3 and Solaris from 2.6 and probably
all others in between. They also work with FreeBSD from 4.1 with
compatible sound card. In fact, the interface is quite generic and
support for other systems, in particular the various Unix generics,
should not be difficult. Volunteers are solicited.

The audio drivers include a number of common features designed to groom
input signals, suppress spikes and normalize signal levels. An automatic
gain control (AGC) feature provides protection against overdriven or
underdriven input signals. It is designed to maintain adequate
demodulator signal amplitude while avoiding occasional noise spikes. In
order to assure reliable operation, the signal level must be in the
range where the audio gain control is effective. In general, this means
the input signal level must be such as to cause the AGC to set the gain
somewhere in the middle of the range from 0 to 255, as indicated in the
timecode displayed by the `ntpq` program.

The IRIG driver operates by disciplining a logical clock based
on the codec sample clock to the audio signal as received. This is done
by stuffing or slipping samples as required to maintain exact frequency
to the order of 0.1 PPM. In order for the driver to reliably lock on the
audio signal, the sample clock frequency tolerance must be less than 250
PPM (.025 percent) for the IRIG driver.
The largest error observed so far is about 60 PPM, but it is possible
some sound cards or codecs may exceed that value. In any case, the
configuration file command `tinker codec` command can be used to change
the systematic offset in units of 125 PPM.

The drivers include provisions to select the input port and to monitor
the input signal. The `fudge flag 2` command selects the microphone port
if set to zero or the line-in port if set to one. It does not seem
useful to specify the compact disc player port. The `fudge flag 3`
command enables the input signal monitor using the previously selected
output port and output gain. Both of these flags can be set in the
configuration file or remotely using the `ntpq` utility program.

[[short]]
== Shortwave Radio Drivers ==

The CHU audio driver requires an external shortwave radio with
the radio output - speaker or headphone jack - connected to either the
microphone or line-in port on the computer. There is some degree of art
in setting up the radio and antenna and getting the setup to work. While
the drivers are highly sophisticated and efficient in extracting timing
signals from noise and interference, it always helps to have as clear a
signal as possible.

The most important factor affecting the radio signal is the antenna. It
need not be long - even 15 feet is enough if it is located outside of a
metal frame building, preferably on the roof, and away from metallic
objects. An ordinary CB whip mounted on a PVC pipe and wooden X-frame on
the roof should work well with most portable radios, as they are
optimized for small antennas.

The radio need not be located near the computer; in fact, it generally
works better if the radio is outside the near field of computers and
other electromagnetic noisemakers. It can be in the elevator penthouse
connected by house wiring, which can also be used to power the radio. A
couple of center-tapped audio transformers will minimize noise pickup
and provide phantom power to the radio with return via the building
ground.

The CHU transmitter operates on several frequencies
simultaneously, so that in most parts of North America at least one
frequency supports propagation to the receiver location at any given
hour. While both drivers support the ICOM CI-V radio interface and can
tune the radio automatically, computer-tunable radios are expensive and
probably not cost effective compared to a GPS receiver. So, the radio
frequency must usually be fixed and chosen by compromise.

Shortwave (3-30 MHz) radio propagation phenomena are well known to
shortwave enthusiasts. The phenomena generally obey the following rules:

* The optimum frequency is higher in daytime than nighttime, stays high
longer on summer days and low longer on winter nights.
* Transitions between daytime and nighttime conditions generally occur
somewhat after sunrise and sunset at the midpoint of the path from
transmitter to receiver.
* Ambient noise (static) on the lower frequencies follows the
thunderstorm season, so is higher on summer afternoons and evenings.
* The lower frequency bands are best for shorter distances, while the
higher bands are best for longer distances.
* The optimum frequencies are higher at the peak of the 11-year sunspot
cycle and lower at the trough.

The best way to choose a frequency is to listen at various times over
the day and determine the highest (daytime) and lowest (nighttime)
frequencies that work well. Choose the frequency that works for the most
number of hours in the day, usually the highest frequency. For instance,
on the east coast the best compromise CHU frequency is 7335 kHz and the
best WWV frequency is 15 MHz.

== Autotune Modes ==

The shortwave drivers include support for an optional autotune function
compatible with ICOM receivers and transceivers. The `mode` keyword of
the `server` configuration command specifies the ICOM ID select code in
decimal. A missing or zero argument disables the CI-V interface. Since
all ICOM select codes are less than 128, the high order bit of the code
is used by the driver to specify the baud rate. If this bit is not set,
the rate is 9600 bps for the newer radios; if set, the rate is 1200 bps
for the older radios. Following are the ID select codes for the known
radios.

[[setup]]
== Setup and Debugging Aids ==

The audio drivers include extensive setup and debugging support to help
hook up the audio signals and monitor the driver operations. The
documentation page for each driver describes the various messages that
can be produced either in real time or written to the `clockstats` file
for later analysis. Of particular help in verifying signal connections
and compatibility is a provision to monitor the signal via headphones or
speaker.

Connecting radios and IRIG devices to the computer and verifying correct
configuration is somewhat of a black art. The signals have to be
connected to the correct ports and the signal level maintained within
tolerances. Some radios have recorder outputs which produce a
microphone-level signal not affected by the volume control. These
signals can be connected to the microphone port on the computer. If the
radio does not have a recorder output, connect the headphone or speaker
output to the line-in port and adjust the volume control so the driver
indicates comfortably above the minimum specified and the AGC level
somewhere in the middle of the range 0-255. IRIG signals are usually
much larger than radio outputs, usually in the range to several volts
and may even overload the line-in port. In such cases the signal is
designed to drive a cable terminated with a 50-ohm resistor, which
results in a level the line-in port can handle..

It is very easy to underdriven or overdrive the audio codec, in which
case the drivers will not synchronize to the signal. The drivers use
`fudge   flag2` to enable audio monitoring of the input signal. This is
useful during setup to confirm the signal is actually reaching the audio
codec and generally free of noise and interference. Note that the
monitor volume must be set before the driver is started.

The drivers write a synthesized timecode to the `clockstats` file each
time the clock is set or verified and at other times if verbose
monitoring is enabled. The format includes several fixed-length fields
defining the UTC time to the millisecond, together with additional
variable-length fields specific to each driver. The data include the
intervals since the clock was last set or verified, the audio gain and
various state variables and counters specific to each driver.
