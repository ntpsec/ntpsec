[glossary]

[[association]]
association::
  An association is the relationship that an NTP client and server have
  when the server is computing and shipping time updates to the server
  and the server is expecting them.  There are several different kinds
  of associations including unicast, manycast, and broadcast modes;
  another variable is whether the association is authenticated or
  unauthenticated.  A significant amount of NTP's complexity is means
  for discovering association partners, creating and maintaining
  associations, and preventing attackers from forming associations.

[[drift]]
drift::
  In an NTP context, refers to the frequency drift of a clock crystal
  in an NTP host, expressed in a parts-per-million offset from its
  nominal frequency. Changes, slowly, in response to environmental
  factors (mainly ambient temperature). {ntpd} measures this by
  sampling the clock and performing clock recovery against a
  phase-locked loop.  The drift measurement is occasionally stored
  locally to a drift file so that when {ntpd} is stopped and restarted
  it doesn't have to go through the entire resampling and resynchronization
  process before providing reliable time.

[[falseticker]]
falseticker::
  <<Mills-speak>> for a timeserver identified as not
  reliable by statistical filtering.  Usually this does not imply any
  problem with the timeserver itself but rather with highly variable
  and asymmetric network delays between server and client/

[[fudge]]
fudge::
  Can have one of two senses.  Either (1) an offset configured for
  a <<refclock>> or server to correct its time, reversing a fixed or
  nearly-fixed propagation delay, or (2) a "fudge bit" set in
  a configuration file to change the refclock's behavior in some
  driver-dependent way.

[[fuzzball]]
fuzzball::
   Historical. An
   https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/database/papers/fuzz.pdf[operating
   system] running on PDP-11s used for early time-service and Internet
   routing experiments. Metonymously, a PDP-11 running the suite.
   While some of these remained in service as late as 1988 they are
   now long gone, but have left a few traces in the NTP codebase.

[[GPSDO]]
GPSDO::
   GPS-constrained Oscillator. A very high-precision atomic clock,
   usually a rubidium or cesium crystal oscillator, periodically
   resynchronized to <<USNO>> time via <<PPS>>. The most accurate time
   source generally available; the only better ones are the
   custom-built atomic clocks maintained by national time authorities.
   Only cost-effective for time service when intrinsic variability in
   network delays is well under GPSDO accuracy; thus, unsuitable for
   use on a WAN, for which plain GPSes with <<PPS>> are cheaper and
   generally good enough.

[[GPSD]]
GPSD::
   The http://www.catb.org/gpsd/[GPS Daemon], an open-source device
   manager for GPSes and other geodetic sensors. Frequently used as
   a clock source by Stratum 1 sites via the SHM
   link:driver28.html[(Type 28)] interface.

[[leapfile]]
leapfile::
   A local file containing the current leap-second offset, typically
   fetched from <<USNO>> or <<NIST>> and potentially needing updates
   near the very beginning or end of each quarter. Normally retrieved
   by a cron(1) job, but some varieties of <<refclock>> (notably
   GPses) update it themselves suring normal operation.

[[Mills-speak]]
Mills-speak::
   Dr. David Mills, the original architect of NTP and its standards,
   wrote in a vivid and idiosyncratic style which is still preserved in
   much of NTP's documentation.  He coined many neologisms which
   connoisseurs refer to as "Mills-speak"; examples in this glossary
   include <<falseticker>>, <<proventic>>, and <<truechimer>>.

[[NIST]]
NIST::
   http://www.nist.gov/[National Institute of Standards and
   Technology].  The civilian national time authority of the USA;
   runs <<WWVB>>.  Responsible for keeping U.S. civil time
   coordinated with international UTC time.  NIST time tracks <<USNO>>
   time to within a few nanoseconds.

[[NTP-classic]]
NTP Classic::
   The original reference implementation of NTP by Dave Mills, later
   maintained by the Network Time Foundation.  NTPsec forked from it
   on June 6th, 2015.

[[nonce]]
nonce::
  An arbitrary number that may only be used once. a random or
  pseudo-random number issued in an authentication protocol (such as
  NTP's) to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in replay
  attacks.

[[parse-driver]]
parse driver::
  A refclock link:driver8.html[(type 8)] which, uniquely, handles
  multiple <<time radio>> protocols - two dozen mostly European
  precision time radios mostly using DCF, the broadcast time from the
  German national authority. Each clock type is internally represented
  as a few parse methods and table entries in a table-driven parser.

[[PPS]]
PPS::
  (Also as "1PPS") Pulse Per Second. A top-of-second pulse emitted
  over RS232 handshake lines by some GPSes that, along with in-band
  time delivered to 1-second accuracy, represents U.S. military time
  (a very close approximation of UTC) to 50-nanosecond accuracy.
  Nowadays the single most important time reference for most NTP
  servers en outside the U.S.A.

[[proventic]]
proventic::
  <<Mills-speak>> for "the transitive completion of the
  authentication relationship", defined in RFC5906. Time is proventic
  if it is provided by a chain of time servers between which packets
  are authenticated and the chain reaches back to Stratum 1.

[[refclock]]
refclock::
  Shorthand for a "reference clock", a primary time source. A computer
  with a refclock is implicitly Stratum 1.

[[SADA]]
SADA::
   Sun Audio Driver API, a software interface to audio devices
   directly supported by NTP and used by the Irig Audio Decoder (type
   6) and IRIG (type 7) refclocks. Originating in SunOS, it was later
   implemented in Solaris and OpenSolaris, supported in the Linux OSS
   sound layer, and is still used by the *BSD family of open-source
   operating systems.

[[stratum]]
stratum::
  A "stratum" is a layer in the hieratchy of time servers.  a
  <<refclock>> is considered stratum 0; a computer directly attached to
  a refclock is stratum 1; and a client served by a stratum N is
  stratum N+1. Often capitalized, especially when referring to all
  members of a stratum. While strata up to 15 are defined, it is
  unusual to see a public timeserver with stratum > 3, and thus
  almost all NTP clients are at Stratum 4 or lower.

[[time-radio]]
time radio::
  A radio receiver specialized for picking up accurate time reference
  signals broadcast over the air by a national time authority; notable
  ones include <<WWVB>> (U.S.), CHU (Canada), DCF (Germany), and MSF
  (United Kingdom).  Usable as a Stratum 1 time source; may be
  qualified by "precision time radio" to distinguish from
  consumer-grade "atomic clocks", which are time radios that normally
  take radio synchronization just once a day and are _not_ accurate
  enough to be used for Stratum 1.  Precision time radios used to be
  important time sources, but (especially in the U.S.) have been
  largely obsolesced by GPS and <<GPSDO>>-based clocks.

[[truechimer]]
truechimer::
  <<Mills-speak>> for a timeserver that provides time believed good,
  that is with low jitter with respect to UTC.  As with a
  link#falseticker[falseticker], this is usually less a property of
  the server itself than it is of favorable network topology.

[[USNO]]
USNO::
  http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO[The United States Naval Observatory],
  one of tthe two U.S. national time authorities and the source of the
  U.S. military time reference, now delivered primarily by GPS
  signals. U.S. civil and military time agree to within nanoseconds.

[[WWVB]]
WWVB::
  The U.S. national time radio station, run by <<NIST>> and
  broadcasting a highly accurate U.S. civil-time reference.  Formerly
  an important primary time source, until NIST changed its modulation
  in 2013 and obsolesced all then-existing U.S. precision time radios. No
  WWVB-compatible precision time radios have been manufactured since,
  though consumer-grade "atomic clocks" unaffected by the modulation
  change are still made.
