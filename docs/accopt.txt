== Commands and Options ==

Unless noted otherwise, further information about these ccommands is on
the link:accopt.html[Access Control Support] page.

`discard` [ `average` 'avg' ][ `minimum` 'min' ] [ `monitor` 'prob' ]::
  Set the parameters of the rate control facility which protects the
  server from client abuse. If the `limited` flag is present in the ACL,
  packets that violate these limits are discarded. If, in addition, the
  `kod` flag is present, a kiss-o'-death packet is returned. See the
  link:rate.html[Rate Management] page for further information. The
  options are:
  `average` 'avg';;
    Specify the minimum average interpacket spacing (minimum average
    headway time) in log~2~ s with default 3.
  `minimum` 'min';;
    Specify the minimum interpacket spacing (guard time) in seconds with
    default 2.
  `monitor`;;
    Specify the probability of being recorded for packets that overflow
    the MRU list size limit set by `mru maxmem` or `mru maxdepth`. This
    is a performance optimization for servers with aggregate arrivals of
    1000 packets per second or more.
`restrict default` ['flag'][...] 
`restrict source` ['flag'][...] 
`restrict address` [`mask` 'mask'] ['flag'][...]`::
  The `address` argument expressed in dotted-quad form is the address of
  a host or network. Alternatively, the `address` argument can be a
  valid host DNS name. The `mask` argument expressed in IPv4 or IPv6
  numeric address form defaults to all mask bits on, meaning that the
  `address` is treated as the address of an individual host. A default
  entry (address 0.0.0.0, mask 0.0.0.0 for IPv4 and address pass:[::]
  mask pass[::] for
  IPv6) is always the first entry in the list. `restrict default`,
  with no mask option, modifies both IPv4 and IPv6 default entries.
  `restrict source` configures a template restriction automatically
  added at runtime for each association, whether configured, ephemeral,
  or preemptible, and removed when the association is demobilized.

  Some flags have the effect to deny service, some have the effect to
  enable service and some are conditioned by other flags. The flags. are
  not orthogonal, in that more restrictive flags will often make less
  restrictive ones redundant. The flags that deny service are classed in
  two categories, those that restrict time service and those that
  restrict informational queries and attempts to do run-time
  reconfiguration of the server. One or more of the following flags may
  be specified:
  `flake`;;
    Discard received NTP packets with probability 0.1; that is, on
    average drop one packet in ten. This is for testing and amusement.
    The name comes from Bob Braden's _flakeway_, which once did a
    similar thing for early Internet testing.
  `ignore`;;
    Deny packets of all kinds, including `ntpq` queries.
  `kod`;;
    Send a kiss-o'-death (KoD) packet if the `limited` flag is present
    and a packet violates the rate limits established by the `discard`
    command. KoD packets are themselves rate limited for each source
    address separately. If the `kod` flag is used in a restriction which
    does not have the `limited` flag, no KoD responses will result.
  `limited`;;
    Deny time service if the packet violates the rate limits established
    by the `discard` command. This does not apply to `ntpq`
    queries.
  `lowpriotrap`;;
    Declare traps set by matching hosts to be low priority. The number
    of traps a server can maintain is limited (the current limit is 3).
    Traps are usually assigned on a first come, first served basis, with
    later trap requestors being denied service. This flag modifies the
    assignment algorithm by allowing low priority traps to be overridden
    by later requests for normal priority traps.
  `mssntp`;;
    Enable Microsoft Windows MS-SNTP authentication using Active
    Directory services. *Note: Potential users should be aware that
    these services involve a TCP connection to another process that
    could potentially block, denying services to other users. Therefore,
    this flag should be used only for a dedicated server with no clients
    other than MS-SNTP.*
  `nomodify`;;
    Deny `ntpq` queries which attempt to modify the state of
    the server (i.e., run time reconfiguration). Queries which return
    information are permitted.
  `noquery`;;
    Deny `ntpq` queries. Time service is not affected.
  `nopeer`;;
    Deny packets that might mobilize an association unless
    authenticated. This includes broadcast, symmetric-active and
    manycast server packets when a configured association does not
    exist. It also includes `pool` associations, so if you want to use
    servers from a `pool` directive and also want to use `nopeer` by
    default, you'll want a `"restrict source ..."` line as well that
    does _not_ include the `nopeer` directive. Note that this flag does
    not apply to packets that do not attempt to mobilize an association.
  `noserve`;;
    Deny all packets except `ntpq` queries.
  `notrap`;;
    Decline to provide mode 6 control message trap service to matching
    hosts. The trap service is a subsystem of the `ntpq` control
    message protocol which is intended for use by remote event logging
    programs.
  `notrust`;;
    Deny packets that are not cryptographically authenticated. Note
    carefully how this flag interacts with the `auth` option of the
    `enable` and `disable` commands. If `auth` is enabled, which is the
    default, authentication is required for all packets that might
    mobilize an association. If `auth` is disabled, but the `notrust`
    flag is not present, an association can be mobilized whether or not
    authenticated. If `auth` is disabled, but the `notrust` flag is
    present, authentication is required only for the specified
    address/mask range.
  `ntpport`;;
    This is actually a match algorithm modifier, rather than a
    restriction flag. Its presence causes the restriction entry to be
    matched only if the source port in the packet is the standard NTP
    UDP port (123). A restrict line containing `ntpport` is considered
    more specific than one with the same address and mask, but lacking
    `ntpport`.
  `version`;;
    Deny packets that do not match the current NTP version.
  Default restriction list entries with the flags `ignore, ntpport`, for
  each of the local host's interface addresses are inserted into the
  table at startup to prevent the server from attempting to synchronize
  to its own time. A default entry is also always present, though if it
  is otherwise unconfigured; no flags are associated with the default
  entry (i.e., everything besides your own NTP server is unrestricted).
