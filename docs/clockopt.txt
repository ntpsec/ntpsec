== Reference Clock Adddresses ==

Unless noted otherwise, further information about these ccommands is on
the link:refclock.html[Reference Clock Support] page.

Reference clocks are identified by a syntactically correct but invalid
IP address, in order to distinguish them from ordinary NTP peers. These
addresses are of the form 127.127._t_._u_, where _t_ is an integer
denoting the clock type and _u_ indicates the unit number in the range
0-3. While it may seem overkill, it is in fact sometimes useful to
configure multiple reference clocks of the same type, in which case the
unit numbers must be unique.

[[cmd]]
== Commands and Options ==

`server 127.127.`'t'.'u' [`prefer`] [`mode` 'int'] [`minpoll` 'int'] [`maxpoll` 'int']::
  This command can be used to configure reference clocks in special
  ways. The options are interpreted as follows:
  `prefer`;;
    Marks the reference clock as preferred. All other things being
    equal, this host will be chosen for synchronization among a set of
    correctly operating hosts. See the link:prefer.html[Mitigation Rules
    and the `prefer` Keyword] page for further information.
  `mode` 'int';;
    Specifies a mode number which is interpreted in a device-specific
    fashion. For instance, it selects a dialing protocol in the ACTS
    driver and a device subtype in the `parse` drivers.
   `minpoll` 'int';;
   `maxpoll` 'int';;
    These options specify the minimum and maximum polling interval for
    reference clock messages in log~2~ seconds. For most directly
    connected reference clocks, both `minpoll` and `maxpoll` default to
    6 (64 s). For modem reference clocks, `minpoll` is ordinarily set to
    10 (about 17 m) and `maxpoll` to 15 (about 9 h). The allowable range
    is 4 (16 s) to 17 (36 h) inclusive.
`fudge 127.127.`'t'.'u' [`time1` 'sec'] [`time2` 'sec'] [`stratum` 'int'] [`refid` 'string'] [`flag1 0|1`] [`flag2 0|1`] [`flag3 0|1`] [`flag4 0|1`]::
  This command can be used to configure reference clocks in special
  ways. It must immediately follow the `server` command which configures
  the driver. Note that the same capability is possible at run time
  using the link:ntpdc.html[`ntpdc`] program. The options are interpreted as follows:
  `time1` 'sec';;
    Specifies a constant to be added to the time offset produced by the
    driver, a fixed-point decimal number in seconds. This is used as a
    calibration constant to adjust the nominal time offset of a
    particular clock to agree with an external standard, such as a
    precision PPS signal. It also provides a way to correct a systematic
    error or bias due to serial port or operating system latencies,
    different cable lengths or receiver internal delay. The specified
    offset is in addition to the propagation delay provided by other
    means, such as internal DIPswitches. Where a calibration for an
    individual system and driver is available, an approximate correction
    is noted in the driver documentation pages.
    Note: in order to facilitate calibration when more than one radio
    clock or PPS signal is supported, a special calibration feature is
    available. It takes the form of an argument to the `enable` command
    described in the link:miscopt.html[Miscellaneous Options] page and
    operates as described in the link:refclock.html[Reference Clock
    Support] page.
  `time2` 'secs';;
    Specifies a fixed-point decimal number in seconds, which is
    interpreted in a driver-dependent way. See the descriptions of
    specific drivers in the link:refclock.html[Reference Clock Support]
    page.
  `stratum` 'int';;
    Specifies the stratum number assigned to the driver in the range 0
    to 15, inclusive. This number overrides the default stratum number
    ordinarily assigned by the driver itself, usually zero.
  `refid` 'string';;
    Specifies an ASCII string of from one to four characters which
    defines the reference identifier used by the driver. This string
    overrides the default identifier ordinarily assigned by the driver
    itself.
  `flag1 flag2 flag3 flag4`;;
    These four flags are used for customizing the clock driver. The
    interpretation of these values, and whether they are used at all, is
    a function of the particular driver. However, by convention `flag4`
    is used to enable recording monitoring data to the `clockstats` file
    configured with the `filegen` command. Additional information on the
    `filegen` command is on the link:monopt.html[Monitoring Options]
    page.
