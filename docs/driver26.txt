== Synopsis ==

["literal",subs="normal"]
Address: 127.127.26.'u'
Reference ID: GPS
Driver ID: GPS_HP
Serial Port: /dev/hpgps__u__; 9600 baud, 8-bits, no parity, 19200 baud 7-bits, odd parity for the HP Z3801A

== Description ==

This driver supports the HP 58503A Time and Frequency Reference Receiver
and HP Z3801A GPS Receiver. They use HP SmartClock (TM) to implement an
Enhanced GPS receiver. The receiver accuracy when locked to GPS in
normal operation is better than 1 usec. The accuracy when operating in
holdover is typically better than 10 us per day. It receiver should be
operated with factory default settings. Initial driver operation:
expects the receiver to be already locked to GPS, configured and able to
output timecode format 2 messages.

The driver uses the poll sequence `:PTIME:TCODE?` to get a response from
the receiver. The receiver responds with a timecode string of ASCII
printing characters, followed by a <cr><lf>, followed by a prompt string
issued by the receiver, in the following format:

-------------------------------------
T#yyyymmddhhmmssMFLRVcc<cr><lf>scpi >
-------------------------------------

The driver processes the response at the <cr> and <lf>, so what the
driver sees is the prompt from the previous poll, followed by this
timecode. The prompt from the current poll is (usually) left unread
until the next poll. So (except on the very first poll) the driver sees
this:

-------------------------------------
scpi >T#yyyymmddhhmmssMFLRVcc<cr><lf>
-------------------------------------

The T is the on-time character, at 980 msec. before the next 1PPS edge.
The # is the timecode format type. We look for format 2. Without any of
the CLK or PPS stuff, then, the receiver buffer timestamp at the <cr> is
24 characters later, which is about 25 msec. at 9600 bps, so the first
approximation for fudge time1 is nominally -0.955 seconds. This number
probably needs adjusting for each machine / OS type, so far: -0.955000
on an HP 9000 Model 712/80 HP-UX 9.05 -0.953175 on an HP 9000 Model 370
HP-UX 9.10

This driver will probably work with the 58503B and 59551A if they are
setup appropriately.

To use an HP Z3801A, specify `mode 1` on the server config line to setup
the right line paramters.

== Fudge Factors ==

`time1` 'time'::
   Specifies the time offset calibration factor, in seconds and fraction,
   with default 0.0.
`time2` 'time'::
   Not used by this driver.
`stratum` 'number'::
   Specifies the driver stratum, in decimal from 0 to 15, with default 0.
`refid` 'string'::
   Specifies the driver reference identifier, an ASCII string from one to
   four characters, with default `GPS`.
`flag1 0 | 1`::
   Not used by this driver.
`flag2 0 | 1`::
   Not used by this driver.
`flag3 0 | 1`::
   Not used by this driver.
`flag4 0 | 1`::
   Not used by this driver.
