== Synopsis ==

["verse",subs="normal"]
Address: 127.127.9.'u'
Reference ID: GPS
Serial Port: /dev/gps__u__; 4800bps 8N1
Features: +ppsclock+ (required)

== Deprecation warning ==

This refclock is deprecated and obsolete. The {project-shortname}
maintainers plan to remove it in a future release.  If you have a
requirement for it, please make this known to us.

== Description ==

This driver supports the Magnavox MX4200 Navigation Receiver adapted to
precision timing applications. This driver supports all compatible
receivers such as the 6-channel MX4200, MX4200D, and the 12-channel
MX9212, MX9012R, MX9112.

Geosystems] acquired the Magnavox commercial GPS technology business in
February of 1994. They marketed and supported former Magnavox GPS
products such as the MX4200 and its successors.

== Operating Modes ==

This driver supports two modes of operation, static and mobile,
controlled by clock flag 2.

In static mode (the default) the driver assumes that the GPS antenna is
in a fixed location. The receiver is initially placed in a "Static, 3D
Nav" mode, where latitude, longitude, elevation and time are calculated
for a fixed station. An average position is calculated from this data.
After 24 hours, the receiver is placed into a "Known Position" mode,
initialized with the calculated position, and then solves only for time.

In mobile mode, the driver assumes the GPS antenna is mounted on a
moving platform such as a car, ship, or aircraft. The receiver is placed
in "Dynamic, 3D Nav" mode and solves for position, altitude and time
while moving. No position averaging is performed.

== Monitor Data ==

The driver writes each timecode as received to the +clockstats+ file.
Documentation for the 'NMEA-0183' proprietary sentences produced by the
MX4200 can be found in link:mx4200data.html[MX4200 Receiver Data
Format].

== Fudge Factors ==

+time1+ 'time'::
   Specifies the time offset calibration factor, in seconds and fraction,
   with default 0.0.
+time2' 'time'::
   Not used by this driver.
+stratum+ 'number'::
   Specifies the driver stratum, in decimal from 0 to 15, with default 0.
+refid+ 'string'::
   Specifies the driver reference identifier, an ASCII string from one to
   four characters, with default +GPS+.
+flag1 {0 | 1}+::
   Not used by this driver.
+flag2 {0 | 1}+::
   Assume GPS receiver is on a mobile platform if set.
+flag3 {0 | 1}+::
   Not used by this driver.
+flag4 {0 | 1}+::
   Not used by this driver.
