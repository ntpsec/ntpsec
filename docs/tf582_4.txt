= European Automated Computer Time Services =

The National Laboratories of many European countries provide
time information in a standardised format, an ITU-R
Recommendation (ITU-R TF583.4).  Information is provided
over a dial-up modem, with one 78-char segment every second.
A description of the time code is available at
https://www.ptb.de/cms/en/ptb/fachabteilungen/abt4/fb-44/ag-442/dissemination-of-legal-time/dissemination-of-time-via-the-public-telephone-network/the-european-telephone-time-code.html

The following countries have traditionally provided this service:
Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal,
Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and United Kingdom.

Note that the service is usually available from outside the country
as well, as long as you are willing to make a long-distance phone
call.
