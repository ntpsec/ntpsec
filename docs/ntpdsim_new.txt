[[caveat]]
== Caveat Emptor ==

At present, if you attempt to build `ntpsdsim` it probably won't, and
if built it would probably fail.  Its code has been dusty and
neglected for a long time.  This documentation is retained mainly as a
matter of historical interest.

The {project-shortname} maintainers have an internal project
code-named TESTFRAME that intends to create the capability 
for replicable end-to-end testing of `ntpd`.  It is likely
that some version of thius code will replace or merge in ntpdsim's
capabilities.

[[description]]
== Description ==

The ntpdsim program is used to simulate and study the behavior of an NTP
daemon that derives its time from a number of different simulated time
sources (servers). Each simulated server can be configured to have a
different time offset, frequency offset, propagation delay, processing
delay, network jitter and oscillator wander.

The ntpdsim program runs all the same selection, mitigation, and
discipline algorithms as the actual ntpd daemon at the client. (It
actually uses the same code). However, the input/output routines and
servers are simulated. That is, instead of sending the client messages
over the network to the actual servers, the client messages are
intercepted by the ntpdsim program, which then generates the replies to
those messages. The reply messages are carefully "inserted" into the
input queue of the client at the right time according to the specified
server properties (like propagation delay).

Each simulated server runs according to a specified script that
describes the server properties at a particular time. Each script
consists of a series of consecutive acts. Each act runs for a particular
duration and specifies the frequency offset, propagation delay,
processing delay, network jitter and oscillator wander of the server for
that duration. Once the duration of an act expires, the simulated server
reconfigures itself according to the properties specified in the next
act.

[[configuration]]
== Configuration ==

The ntpdsim program is configured by providing a configuration file at
startup. The crux of the simulator configuration is specified using a
`simulate` command, the syntax of which is given below. Note that all
time quantities are in seconds and all frequency quantities are in parts
per million (PPM):

'<simulate_command>' ::= `simulate` { '<init_statement_list> <server_list>' } +
'<init_statement_list>' ::= <init_statement_list> <init_statement> ; | <init_statement> ; +
'<init_statement>' ::= `beep_delay` = <number> | `simulation_duration` = <number> + 
'<server_list>' ::= '<server_list>' <server> | <server> +
'<server_list>' ::= `server` = <address> { `server_offset` = <number> ; <act_list> } +
'<act_list>' ::= '<act_list> <act>' | '<act>' +
'<act>' ::= `duration` = <number> { '<act_stmt_list>' } +
'<act_stmt_list>' ::= '<act_stmt_list> <act_stmt>' ; | '<act_stmt>' ; +
'<act_stmt>' ::= `freq_offset` = <number> | `wander` = <number> | `jitter` = <number> | `prop_delay` = <number> | `proc_delay` = <number> +

In addition to the `simulate` command, other standard NTP configuration
commands can be specified. These commands have the same meaning as in
the ntpd configuration. Note that newlines are *not* significant within
the `simulate` command even though they are used to mark the end of a
normal NTP configuration command. While a newline is an "end of command"
terminator for other configuration commands, in the `simulate` stanza
`;` (the semicolon) is the "end of command" terminator.

[[sample]]
== Sample Configuration File ==

A sample ntpdsim configuration file is given below. It specifies two
simulated servers, each of which has two acts.
