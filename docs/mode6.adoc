[[intro]]
== Introduction ==

This page describes the Mode 6 protocol used to get status information
from a running ntpd and configure some of its behaviors on the fly.
The protocol is normally used by the 'ntpq' and 'ntpmon' program
distributed with the suite. It is fully documented here so that other
clients can be written.

(Note that the most efficient way to write a new client is to use
the Python Mode 6 libraries included in the distribution. Both 'ntpq'
and 'ntpmon' use these.)

[[packet]]
== Mode 6 packet structure ==

The protocol uses UDP packets transmitted and received over port 123.
They use the same structure (header, plus extension, plus optional
MAC) as time synchronization messages, but the layout and semantics of
the header fields are different.  They are distinguished from time
synchronization packets by their Mode field, which has the value 6
(110).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In mode 6 packets, the leap indicator (LI) is ignored and normally
zero.  The version (VN) is the NTP protocol major version, currently
4.  Mode is 6.  The following field interpretations are specific to
mode 6:

|=====================================================================
| Response bit   | 1 in a response, 0 in a request
| Error bit      | 1 in an error response, 0 otherwise
| More           | 1 if payload is continued in next packet, 0 otherwise
| Sequence       | Sequence number for multi-packet reassembly
| Status         | System status word
| Association ID | Association ID of peer, or 0 for the ntpd host
| Offset         | Octet offset of this fragment in the response
| Count          | Octet count of fragment payload
|=====================================================================

Requests to ntpd are single UDP packets; ntpd expects them to be
padded to a 4-octet boundary.  Responses may be multiple UDP packets;
they may arrive out of order, and the client is responsible for
reassembling the payloads.

All multibyte numeric fields are interpreted as big-endian
2's-complement integers.

The maximum length of the Mode 6 payload is constrained by the
minimum-maximum UDP payload size of 576. As of late 2018 there is no
language in the NTP RFCs pinning it down. A draft RFC on Mode 6 says
it's 500 octets, which is far in excess of any plausible request or
response size in the actual protocol.

[[varlists]]
== Variable-Value Lists ==

Several requests and responses (in fact, all but one) use a common
textual payload format consisting of a comma-separated list of items.
An item may be a textual (ASCII) variable name, or a textual variable
name followed by an equals sign followed by a textual value. Following
any comma the format may insert a newline; these are not significant
to the meaning of the payload, but are placed so that if the payload
is dumped to an 80 character terminal window the lines will be folded
in a way convenient for visibility.

Values may be decimal numeric literals, decimal float literals, hex
numeric literals led with "0x", binary literals consisting of exactly
two of digits 0 and 1, NTP date stamps, or string literals enclosed in
double quotes.

NTP date stamps are represented by hexadecimal fixed-point literals
led with "0x", distinguished from hexadecimal integers by the embedded
radix point (".").  They represent seconds (and fractional seconds)
since the epoch of the current NTP era.  NTP era zero began at 00:00
of January 1st 1900.

String literals never contain newlines or other control
characters. One quirk of the format is that a bare variable name
without a following "=" may be interpreted in context as an
instruction to set a string-valued variable to the empty string.

Textual responses may end with padding NULs; clients should ignore
these.

In RFC 5234 ABNF:

-----------------------------------------------------------
varlist = item [itemtail] LF *%x00

itemtail = "," [1LF] item [itemtail]

item = name / name "=" value

value = 1*DIGIT / 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT  / "0x" 1*HEXDIG / 2BIT / quoted-string

quoted-string = %x22 *(%21 | %x23-7E) %x22
-----------------------------------------------------------

[[requests]]
== Mode 6 Requests ==

Request-response types are distinguished by operation codes.  The
table below lists them all. The "Auth?" column tells whether a
request requires authentication from the client.

[options="header"]
|=====================================================================
|Name                   |Value  | Auth? | Use
|CTL_OP_READSTAT	| 1	| No    | read system or peer status
|CTL_OP_READVAR		| 2	| No    | read system or peer variables
|CTL_OP_WRITEVAR	| 3	| Yes   | write variables
|CTL_OP_READCLOCK	| 4	| No    | read clock variables
|CTL_OP_WRITECLOCK	| 5	| -     | write clock variables
|CTL_OP_SETTRAP		| 6	| -     | set trap address (obsolete, unused)
|CTL_OP_ASYNCMSG	| 7	| -     | asynchronous message (unused)
|CTL_OP_CONFIGURE	| 8	| Yes   | runtime configuration
|CTL_OP_READ_MRU	| 10	| No    | retrieve MRU (mrulist)
|CTL_OP_READ_ORDLIST_A	| 11	| Yes   | ordered list req. auth.
|CTL_OP_REQ_NONCE	| 12	| No    | request a client nonce
|CTL_OP_UNSETTRAP	| 31	| -     | unset trap (obsolete, unused)
|=====================================================================

The CTL_OP_SETTRAP and CTL_OP_UNSETTRAP opcodes relate to an obsolete
notification facility supported in some older versions of the
software. CTL_OP_WRITECLOCK is unimplemented and will throw a
permission error. CTL_OP_ASYNCMSG is reserved for expansion. The
remaining opcodes are as follows:

=== CTL_OP_READSTAT ===

This requests ntpd to ship up a list of association IDs and status
words for all peers currently associated with the ntpd instance. It
does not require authentication.

The normal use case for this request is to discover the current list
of associations preparatory to querying peer variables for each
association.

There is no request payload.  The response payload is not textual.  It
consists of a sequence of pairs, each consisting of 16-bit association
ID followed by 16-bit status word, both unsigned in network
(big-endian) byte order.  There is no padding in the response. The
number of IDs is implicitly given by the payload length in octets,
divided by 4.

Interpretation of the peer status word is described
link:decode.html#peer[here].

=== CTL_OP_READVAR ===

This requests ntpd to ship up a list of peer variable settings for an
association specified by ID, or system variables if the ID is zero. It
does not require authentication.

The request payload may be empty or a textual variable list of
variables to be reported in the response. An empty request payload
calls for a report on all known variables.

The response payload is a textual varlist.

=== CTL_OP_WRITEVAR ===

Some system variable are defined as being settable from a mode 6
client. This request provides a general way to do that. It requires
authentication.

The request payload is a textual list of variable settings.  Any
variable name that is unknown or not settable immediately terminates
processing of the payload. This request is only valid with an
association ID of 0. There is no response payload.

No system variables are currently settable.  This may change in a
future release.

=== CTL_OP_READCLOCK ===

This requests ntpd to ship up a list of peer variable settings for a
reference clock association specified by ID. It does not require
authentication.

The request payload may be empty or a textual variable list of
variables to be reported in the response. An empty request payload
calls for a report on all known variables.

The response payload is a textual varlist.

=== CTL_OP_CONFIGURE ===

This request is used to change the configuration of ntpd without
restarting the daemon.  It requires authentication.

The request payload should be a line of text in the syntax of the
ntp.conf configuration file.  The response payload will begin with either
an error message or the string "Config Succeeded", followed by a NUL.

Note: Due to an implementation error, the response packet may and
typically will contain trailing garbage. Implementations should
expect this and truncate it at the first NUL.

=== CTL_OP_READ_MRU ===

This request is used to retrieve information about recent traffic
between ntpd and its clients and peers; in NTP-speak this traffic summary is
called the "MRU list", where MRU stands for "most recently used".  It does
not require authentication.

//Keep this in sync with the big comment in ntpd/ntp_control.c,
//from which it is derived.

A finite and variable number of entries are retrieved per request, to
avoid having responses with such large numbers of packets that socket
buffers are overflowed and packets lost.  The entries are retrieved
oldest-first, taking into account that the MRU list will be changing
between each request.  We can expect to see duplicate entries for
addresses updated in the MRU list during the fetch operation.  In the
end, the client can assemble a close approximation of the MRU list at
the point in time the last response was sent by ntpd.  The only
difference is it may be longer, containing some number of oldest
entries which have since been reclaimed.  If necessary, the protocol
could be extended to zap those from the client snapshot at the end,
but so far that doesn't seem useful.

To accommodate the changing MRU list, the starting point for requests
after the first request is supplied as a series of last seen
timestamps and associated addresses, the newest ones the client has
received.  As long as at least one of those entries hasn't been
bumped to the head of the MRU list, ntpd can pick up at that point.
Otherwise, the request is failed and it is up to ntpq to back up and
provide the next newest entry's timestamps and addresses, conceivably
backing up all the way to the starting point.

The request payload is a textual varlist that must include
some of the following variables and may include others:

nonce::		Regurgitated nonce retrieved by the client
		previously using CTL_OP_REQ_NONCE, demonstrating
		ability to receive traffic sent to its address.

frags::		Limit on datagrams (fragments) in response.  Used
		by newer ntpq versions instead of limit= when
		retrieving multiple entries.

limit::		Limit on MRU entries returned.  One of frags= or limit=
		must be provided.  limit=1 is a special case: Instead of
		fetching beginning with the supplied starting point's
		newer neighbor, fetch the supplied entry, and in that
		case the #.last timestamp can be zero.  This enables
		fetching a single entry by IP address.  When limit is
		not one and frags= is provided, the fragment limit
		controls.

mincount::	(decimal) Return entries with packet count >= mincount.

maxlstint::	(decimal) Return entries with lstint <= maxlstint.
		(lstint is now-time of most recent packet)

laddr::		Return entries associated with the server's IP
		address given.  No port specification is needed,
		and any supplied is ignored.

recent::	Set the reporting start point to retrieve roughly
		a specified number of most recent entries
		'Roughly' because the logic cannot anticipate
		update volume. Use this to volume-limit the
		response when you are monitoring something like
		a pool server with a very long MRU list.

resall::	0x-prefixed hex restrict bits, which must all be
		lit for an MRU entry to be included.
		Has precedence over any resany=.

resany::	0x-prefixed hex restrict bits, at least one of
		which must be list for an MRU entry to be
		included.

last.0::	0x-prefixed hex l_fp timestamp of newest entry
		which client previously received.

addr.0::	text of newest entry's IP address and port,
		IPv6 addresses in bracketed form: [::]:123

last.1::	timestamp of 2nd newest entry client has.

addr.1::	address of 2nd newest entry.

More entries may follow; ntpq provides as many last/addr pairs as will
fit in a single request packet, except for the first request in a MRU
fetch operation.

The response begins with a new nonce value to be used for any
followup request.  Following the nonce is the next newer entry than
referred to by last.0 and addr.0, if the "0" entry has not been
bumped to the front.  If it has, the first entry returned will be the
next entry newer than referred to by last.1 and addr.1, and so on.
If none of the referenced entries remain unchanged, the request fails
and ntpq backs up to the next earlier set of entries to resync.

Except for the first response, each response begins with confirmation
of the entry that precedes the first additional entry provided:

last.older::	hex l_fp timestamp matching one of the input
		.last timestamps, which entry now precedes the
		response 0. entry in the MRU list.

addr.older::	text of address corresponding to older.last.

And in any case, a successful response contains sets of values
comprising entries, with the oldest numbered 0 and incrementing from
there:

addr.#::	text of IPv4 or IPv6 address and port

last.#::	hex l_fp timestamp of last receipt

first.#::	hex l_fp timestamp of first receipt

ct.#::		count of packets received

mv.#::		mode and version

rs.#::		restriction mask (RES_* bits)

The client should accept the values in any order, and ignore .#
values which it does not understand, to allow a smooth path to
future changes without requiring a new opcode.  To ensure this,
ntpd occasionally issues a randomly-generated tag=value pair. All
such noise tags are three letters long.

Clients can rely on all *.0 values preceding any *.1 values, that is
all values for a given index number are together in the response.

The end of the response list is noted with one or two tag=value
pairs.  Unconditionally:

now::		0x-prefixed l_fp timestamp at the server marking
		the end of the operation.

If any entries were returned, now= is followed by:

last.newest::	hex l_fp identical to last.# of the prior entry.

Portions of the response side of the protocol (specifically the
last.older, addr.older, and last.newest attributes) can be ignored by a
client that is willing to accumulate an entire set of MRU list
fragments and then perform stale-record elimination of its own before
displaying or passing on the report (that is, as opposed to
incremental display with an attempt to suppress stale records on the
fly).

=== CTL_OP_READ_ORDLIST_A ===

This request is used for two purposes: to retrieve restriction lists
and to retrieve interface statistics.  For the former use, the request
payload should be the string "addr_restrictions"; for the latter case,
the request payload should be "ifstats" or empty.  Both uses
require authentication.  The response payload is, in both cases, a
textual varlist.

A response payload consists of a list of attribute stanzas. Each
stanza consists of the attributes with tags of the form "name.#', with
# being replaced by a zero-origin integer literal that is the index of
the stanza.

Attributes within each stanza are deliberately issued in a random
order, and ntpd occasionally issues an attribute with a
randomly-generated name and value. This is an attempt to prevent Mode
6 clients from making brittle assumptions about the inventory of
attributes and their transmission order.

Clients can rely on all *.0 values preceding any *.1 values, that is
all values for a given index number are together in the response.

In a reslist stanza, elicited by "addr_restrictions", the elements are
as follows:

addr.#:: Address to which the restriction applies. May be IPV4 or
	 IPV6.  Has no port suffix

flags.#:: Space-separated list of flag names applying to the address.
	  These flag names are the same as those used in the
	  "restrict" directive of the configuration syntax.

hits.#:: The number of times this rule has been matched.  Not updated
	 for default rules.

mask.#:: Subnet mask qualifying the address to express a range.

In an ifstats stanza, elicited by "ifstats" or an empty string,
attributes are as follows:

addr.#:: Address of the interface. May be IPV4 or
	 IPV6. Has a port suffix.  May be a wildcard; extreme cases
	 are 0.0.0.0 and [::].

bcast.#:: Either a broadcast address associated with the interface or empty.

en.#:: Integer literal. 1 if packets on this interface are processed, 0
       if they are to be ignored.

flags.#:: A hex literal that is a mask of flag bits on.
          Flag mask values are described in a following table.

name.#:: The interface name, such as would occur in an ifconfig listing.

pc.#:: Count of peers using this interface.

rx.#:: Packet reception count.

tl.#:: Last time-to-live specified on a send.

tx.#:: Packet transmission count.

txerr.#:: Packet transmission error count.

up.#:: Uptime in seconds.

|==========================================================================

=== CTL_OP_REQ_NONCE ===

This request is used to initialize an MRU-list conversation.  It
informs ntpd that the Mode 6 client is ready to receive.  It does
not require authentication.

The request retrieves a nonce specific to this client, which will be
played back to ntpd to demonstrate that the client is capable of
receiving responses at the source IP address that requested the nonce,
and is thereby unlikely to be forging the source address.  This check
prevents CTL_OP_READ_MRU from being used for flooding attacks.

The request has no payload.  The response will be a textual varlist
containing one string-valued variable, "nonce". The value need not by
interpreted by the client, only replayed as part of a following MRU-list
request.

Each nonce becomes invalid 16 seconds after the request for it was
received by ntpd. While the issue time is encoded in the nonce, it
is safer practice not to rely on the nonce format but instead to track
the last nonce transmission time in your client and re-request based
on that.

[[auth]]
== Authentication ==

Authenticated requests require a MAC (message authentication code)
trailer following the payload data, if any. Such requests must be
padded to an 8-octet boundary, with those bytes not included in the
header count field.

The contents of the MAC trailer consists of:

1. The 32-bit identifier of the signing key in network byte order.

2a. In digest mode, a cryptographic hash of the following octet spans,
in order. First, the password entered to use the signing key, then the
request header fields, then the payload.

2b. In CMAC mode, a cryptographic hash of the packet header and
payload with the crypto algorithim using the key.

The cryptographic hash is 16 octets for MD5 and AES and 20 octets for SHA1.
Longer digests are truncated.

The key length for AES is 16 bytes.  Longer keys are truncated.  Shorter
keys are padded with 0s.  MD5 and SHA1 can use any key length.

== Compatibility Notes ==

The "recent" parameter of CTL_OP_READ_MRU is not supported in versions
prior to NTPsec 0.9.6.

Export of the count of control requests (ss_numctlreq) is new in NTPsec.
