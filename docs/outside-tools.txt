[[introduction]]
== Introduction ==

Because NTP is a widely-used an sell-established service, people 
who write tools for system administrators not infrequently have
features and plugins designed to help you work with it. This
page collects some references that may be useful.

== Wireshark ==

The https://www.wireshark.org/[Wireshark] protocol analyzer has
support for displaying NTP packets with the fields broken out
and interpreted.

== Nagios ==

The https://www.nagios.org/[Nagios] monitoring suite has native
support for querying NTP servers.  The 'check_ntp_peer' and
'check_ntp_time' programs may be of particular interest.
