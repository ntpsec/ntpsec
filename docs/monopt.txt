[[intro]]
== Naming Conventions ==

The `ntpd` daemon includes a comprehensive monitoring facility which
collects statistical data of various types and writes the data to
files associated with each type at defined events or intervals. The
files associated with a particular type are collectively called the
generation file set for that type. The files in the file set are the
members of that set.

File sets have names specific to the type and generation epoch. The
names are constructed from three concatenated elements _prefix_,
_filename_ and _suffix_:

_prefix_::
  The directory path specified in the `statsdir` command.
_name_::
  The name specified by the `file` option of the `filegen` command.
_suffix_::
  A string of elements beginning with . (dot) followed by a number of
  elements depending on the file set type.

Statistics files can be managed using scripts, examples of which are in
the `./scripts` directory. Using these or similar scripts and Unix
`cron` jobs, the files can be automatically summarized and archived for
retrospective analysis.

== Monitoring Commands and Options ==

Unless noted otherwise, further information about these commands is on
the link:decode.html[Event Messages and Status Codes] page.

page.

`filegen` 'name' [`file` 'filename'] [`type` 'type'] [`link` | `nolink`] [`enable` | `disable`]::
  _name_;;
    Specifies the file set type from the list in the next section.

  `file` 'filename';;
    Specifies the filename prefix. The default is the file set type,
    such as "loopstats".

  `type` 'typename';;
    Specifies the file set interval. The following intervals are
    supported with default `day`:
+
--
`none`::
  The file set is actually a single plain file.

`pid`::
  One file set member is created for every incarnation of `ntpd`.
  The file name suffix is the string .`n`, where `n` is the process
  ID of the `ntpd` server process.

`day`::
  One file set member is created per day. A day is defined as the
  period between 00:00 and 23:59 UTC. The file name suffix is the
  string .`yyyymmdd`, where `yyyy` is the year, `mm` the month of
  the year and `dd` the day of the month. Thus, member created on 10
  December 1992 would have suffix `.19921210`.

`week`::
  One file set member is created per week. The week is defined as
  the day of year modulo 7. The file name suffix is the string
  .`yyyyWww`, where `yyyy` is the year, `W` stands for itself and
  `ww` the week number starting from 0. For example, The member
  created on 10 January 1992 would have suffix `.1992W1`.

`month`::
  One file set member is created per month. The file name suffix is
  the string .`yyyymm`, where `yyyy` is the year and `mm` the month
  of the year starting from 1. For example, The member created on 10
      January 1992 would have suffix `.199201`.

`year`::
  One file set member is generated per year. The file name suffix is
  the string .`yyyy`, where `yyyy` is the year. For example, The
  member created on 1 January 1992 would have suffix `.1992`.

`age`::
  One file set member is generated every 24 hours of `ntpd`
  operation. The filename suffix is the string `.adddddddd`, where
  `a` stands for itself and `dddddddd` is the `ntpd` running time in
  seconds at the start of the corresponding 24-hour period.
--
+
  `link | nolink`;;
    It is convenient to be able to access the current file set members
    by file name, but without the suffix. This feature is enabled by
    `link` and disabled by `nolink`. If enabled, which is the default, a
    hard link from the current file set member to a file without suffix
    is created. When there is already a file with this name and the
    number of links to this file is one, it is renamed by appending a
    dot, the letter `C`, and the pid of the `ntpd` server process. When
    the number of links is greater than one, the file is unlinked. This
    allows the current file to be accessed by a constant name.

  `enable | disable`;;
    Enable or disable the recording function, with default `enable`.
    These options are intended for remote configuration commands.

`statistics` 'name...'::
  Enables writing of statistics records. Currently, eight kinds of
  statistics are supported: _names_ specify the file set type(s) from
  the list in the next section.

`statsdir` 'directory_path'::
  Specify the directory path prefix for statistics file names.

[[types]]
== File Set Types ==

`clockstats`::
  Record reference clock statistics. Each update received from a
  reference clock driver appends one line to the `clockstats` file set:
+
`49213 525.624 127.127.4.1 93 226 00:08:29.606 D`
+

|`127.127.4.1`|IP      |reference clock address
|_`message`_    |text    |log message
|============================================
+
The _`message`_ field includes the last timecode received in decoded
ASCII format, where meaningful. In some cases a good deal of
additional information is displayed. See information specific to each
reference clock for further details.

`cryptostats`::
  Record significant events in the Autokey protocol. This option
  requires the OpenSSL cryptographic software library. Each event
  appends one line to the `cryptostats` file set:
+
`49213 525.624 128.4.1.1` _`message`_

The _`message`_ field includes the message type and certain ancillary
information. See the link:authopt.html[Authentication Options] page
for further information.

`loopstats`::
