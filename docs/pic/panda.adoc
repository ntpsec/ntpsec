.FAX test image for SATNET (1979).

The baby panda was scanned at University College London and used as a
FAX test image for a demonstration of the DARPA Atlantic SATNET Program
and the first transatlantic Internet connection in 1978. The computing
system used for that demonstration was called the
{millshome}database/papers/fuzz.ps[Fuzzball]. As
it happened, this was also the first Internet multimedia presentation
and the first to use a predecessor of NTP in regular operation. The
image was widely copied and used for testing purpose throughout much of
the 1980s.
