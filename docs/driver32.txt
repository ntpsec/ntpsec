== Synopsis ==

["literal",subs="normal"]
Address: 127.127.32._u_
Reference ID: CHRONOLOG
Driver ID: CHRONOLOG
Serial Port: /dev/chronolog_u_; 2400 bps, 8-bits, no parity

Features: `(none)`

== Description ==

This driver supports the Chrono-log K-series WWVB receiver. This is a
very old receiver without provisions for leap seconds, quality codes,
etc. It assumes output in the local time zone, and that the C library
mktime()/localtime() routines will correctly convert back and forth
between local and UTC. There is a hack in the driver for permitting UTC,
but it has not been tested.

Most of this code is originally from refclock_wwvb.c (now
refclock_spectracom.c) with thanks. It has been so mangled that wwvb is
not a recognizable ancestor.

----------------------------------------
