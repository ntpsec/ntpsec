[[descrip]]
== Description ==

This program generates cryptographic data files used by the NTPv4
authentication and identity schemes. It can generate message digest keys
used in symmetric key cryptography and, if the OpenSSL software library
has been installed, it can generate host keys, sign keys, certificates,
and identity keys and parameters used by the Autokey public key
cryptography. The message digest keys file is generated in a format
compatible with NTPv3. All other files are in PEM-encoded printable
ASCII format so they can be embedded as MIME attachments in mail to
other sites.

When used to generate message digest keys, the program produces a file
containing ten pseudo-random printable ASCII strings suitable for the
MD5 message digest algorithm included in the distribution. If the
OpenSSL library is installed, it produces an additional ten hex-encoded
random bit strings suitable for the SHA1 and other message digest
algorithms. The message digest keys file must be distributed and stored
using secure means beyond the scope of NTP itself. Besides the keys used
for ordinary NTP associations, additional keys can be defined as
passwords for the link:ntpq.html[`ntpq`] utility program.

The remaining generated files are compatible with other OpenSSL
applications and other Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) resources.
Certificates generated by this program are compatible with extant
industry practice, although some users might find the interpretation of
X509v3 extension fields somewhat liberal. However, the identity keys are
probably not compatible with anything other than Autokey.

Some files used by this program are encrypted using a private password.
The `-p` option specifies the password for local encrypted files and the
`-q` option the password for encrypted files sent to remote sites. If no
password is specified, the host name returned by the Unix
`gethostname()` function, normally the DNS name of the host, is used.

The `pw` option of the `crypto` configuration command specifies the read
password for previously encrypted local files. This must match the local
password used by this program. If not specified, the host name is used.
Thus, if files are generated by this program without password, they can
be read back by `ntpd` without password, but only on the same host.

Normally, encrypted files for each host are generated by that host and
used only by that host, although exceptions exist as noted later on this
page. The symmetric keys file, normally called `ntp.keys`, is usually
installed in `/etc`. Other files and links are usually installed in
`/usr/local/etc`, which is normally in a shared filesystem in
NFS-mounted networks and cannot be changed by shared clients. The
location of the keys directory can be changed by the `keysdir`
configuration command in such cases. Normally, this is in `/etc`.

This program directs commentary and error messages to the standard error
stream `stderr` and remote files to the standard output stream `stdout`
where they can be piped to other applications or redirected to files.
The names used for generated files and links all begin with the string
`ntpkey` and include the file type, generating host and filestamp, as
described in the link:#fmt[Cryptographic Data Files] section below

[[run]]
== Running the Program ==

To test and gain experience with Autokey concepts, log in as root and
change to the keys directory, usually `/usr/local/etc`. When run for the
first time, or if all files with names beginning `ntpkey` have been
removed, use the `ntp-keygen` command without arguments to generate a
default RSA host key and matching RSA-MD5 certificate with expiration
date one year hence. If run again without options, the program uses the
existing keys and parameters and generates only a new certificate with
new expiration date one year hence.

Run the command on as many hosts as necessary. Designate one of them as
the trusted host (TH) using `ntp-keygen` with the `-T` option and
configure it to synchronize from reliable Internet servers. Then
configure the other hosts to synchronize to the TH directly or
indirectly. A certificate trail is created when Autokey asks the
immediately ascendant host towards the TH to sign its certificate, which
is then provided to the immediately descendant host on request. All
group hosts should have acyclic certificate trails ending on the TH.

The host key is used to encrypt the cookie when required and so must be
RSA type. By default, the host key is also the sign key used to encrypt
signatures. A different sign key can be assigned using the `-S` option
and this can be either RSA or DSA type. By default, the signature
message digest type is MD5, but any combination of sign key type and
message digest type supported by the OpenSSL library can be specified
using the `-c` option.

The rules say cryptographic media should be generated with proventic
filestamps, which means the host should already be synchronized before
this program is run. This of course creates a chicken-and-egg problem
when the host is started for the first time. Accordingly, the host time
should be set by some other means, such as eyeball-and-wristwatch, at
least so that the certificate lifetime is within the current year. After
that and when the host is synchronized to a proventic source, the
certificate should be re-generated.

Additional information on trusted groups and identity schemes is on the
link:autokey.html[Autokey Public-Key Authentication] page.

[[cmd]]
== Command Line Options ==

`-b` 'modulus'::
  Set the modulus for generating identity keys to _modulus_ bits. The
  modulus defaults to 256, but can be set from 256 (32 octets) to 2048
  (256 octets). Use the larger moduli with caution, as this can consume
  considerable computing resources and increases the size of
  authenticated packets.
`-c [ RSA-MD2 | RSA-MD5 | RSA-SHA | RSA-SHA1 | RSA-MDC2 | RSA-RIPEMD160 | DSA-SHA | DSA-SHA1 ]`::
  Select certificate digital signature and message digest scheme. Note
  that RSA schemes must be used with an RSA sign key and DSA schemes
  must be used with a DSA sign key. The default without this option is
  `RSA-MD5`. If compatibility with FIPS 140-2 is required, either the
  `DSA-SHA` or `DSA-SHA1` scheme must be used.
`-C` 'cipher'::
  Select the OpenSSL cipher to use for password-protected keys. The
  `openssl -h` command provided with OpenSSL displays available ciphers.
  The default without this option is `des-ede3-cbc`.
`-d`::
  Enable debugging. This option displays the cryptographic data produced
  for eye-friendly billboards.
`-e`::
  Extract the IFF or GQ public parameters from the `IFFkey` or `GQkey`
  keys file previously specified. Send the unencrypted data to the
  standard output stream `stdout`.
`-G`::
  Generate a new encrypted GQ key file for the Guillou-Quisquater (GQ)
  identity scheme. This option is mutually exclusive with the `-I` and
  `-V` options.
`-H`::
  Generate a new encrypted RSA public/private host key file.
`-i` 'group'::
  Set the optional Autokey group name to `group`. This is used in the
  identity scheme parameter file names. In that role, the default is the
  host name if no group is provided. The group name, if specified using
  `-i` or using `-s` following an `@` character, is also used in
  certificate subject and issuer names in the form `host@group` and
  should match the group specified via `crypto ident` or `server ident`
  in ntpd's configuration file.
`-I`::
  Generate a new encrypted IFF key file for the Schnorr (IFF) identity
  scheme. This option is mutually exclusive with the `-G` and `-V`
  options.
`-l` 'days'::
  Set the lifetime for certificates to `days`. The default lifetime is
  one year (365 d).
`-m` 'modulus'::
  Set the modulus for generating files to _modulus_ bits. The modulus
  defaults to 512, but can be set from 256 (32 octets) to 2048 (256
  octets). Use the larger moduli with caution, as this can consume
  considerable computing resources and increases the size of
  authenticated packets.
`-M`::
  Generate a new keys file containing 10 MD5 keys and 10 SHA keys. An
  MD5 key is a string of 20 random printable ASCII characters, while a
  SHA key is a string of 40 random hex digits. The file can be edited
  using a text editor to change the key type or key content. This option
  is mutually exclusive with all other option.
`-P`::
  Generate a new private certificate used by the PC identity scheme. By
  default, the program generates public certificates. Note: the PC
  identity scheme is not recommended for new installations.
`-p` 'passwd'::
  Set the password for reading and writing encrypted files to `passwd.`
  These include the host, sign and identify key files. By default, the
  password is the string returned by the Unix `gethostname()` routine.
`-q` 'passwd'::
  Set the password for writing encrypted IFF, GQ and MV identity files
  redirected to `stdout` to `passwd.` In effect, these files are
  decrypted with the `-p` password, then encrypted with the `-q`
  password. By default, the password is the string returned by the Unix
  `gethostname()` routine.
`-S [ RSA | DSA ]`::
  Generate a new encrypted public/private sign key file of the specified
  type. By default, the sign key is the host key and has the same type.
  If compatibly with FIPS 140-2 is required, the sign key type must be
  `DSA`.
`-s` 'host'[@'group']::
  Specify the Autokey host name, where `host` is the host name and
  `group` is the optional group name. The host name, and if provided,
  group name are used in `host@group` form as certificate subject and
  issuer. Specifying `-s @group` is allowed, and results in leaving the
  host name unchanged, as with `-i group`. The group name, or if no
  group is provided, the host name are also used in the file names of
  IFF, GQ, and MV identity scheme parameter files. If `host` is not
  specified, the default host name is the string returned by the
  `gethostname()` routine.
`-T`::
  Generate a trusted certificate. By default, the program generates
  nontrusted certificates.
`-V` 'nkeys'::
  Generate `nkeys` encrypted server keys for the Mu-Varadharajan (MV)
  identity scheme. This option is mutually exclusive with the `-I` and
  `-G` options. Note: support for this option should be considered a
  work in progress.

[[rand]]
== Random Seed File ==

All cryptographically sound key generation schemes must have means to
randomize the entropy seed used to initialize the internal pseudo-random
number generator used by the OpenSSL library routines. If a site
supports `ssh`, it is very likely that means to do this are already
available. The entropy seed used by the OpenSSL library is contained in
a file, usually called `.rnd`, which must be available when starting the
`ntp-keygen` program or `ntpd` daemon.

The OpenSSL library looks for the file using the path specified by the
`RANDFILE` environment variable in the user home directory, whether root
or some other user. If the `RANDFILE` environment variable is not
present, the library looks for the `.rnd` file in the user home
directory. Since both the `ntp-keygen` program and `ntpd` daemon must
run as root, the logical place to put this file is in `/.rnd` or
`/root/.rnd`. If the file is not available or cannot be written, the
program exits with a message to the system log.

[[fmt]]
== Cryptographic Data Files ==

File and link names are in the form _`ntpkey_key_name.fstamp`_, where
_`key`_ is the key or parameter type, _`name`_ is the host or group name and
_`fstamp`_ is the filestamp (NTP seconds) when the file was created). By
convention, _`key`_ names in generated file names include both upper and
lower case characters, while _`key`_ names in generated link names
include only lower case characters. The filestamp is not used in
generated link names.

The _`key`_ name is a string defining the cryptographic key type. Key
types include public/private keys `host` and `sign`, certificate `cert`
and several challenge/response key types. By convention, client files
used for challenges have a `par` subtype, as in the IFF challenge
`IFFpar`, while server files for responses have a `key` subtype, as in
the GQ response `GQkey`.

All files begin with two nonencrypted lines. The first line contains the
file name in the format _`ntpkey_key_host.fstamp`_. The second line
contains the datestamp in conventional Unix `date` format. Lines
beginning with `#` are ignored.

The remainder of the file contains cryptographic data encoded first
using ASN.1 rules, then encrypted using the DES-CBC algorithm with given
password and finally written in PEM-encoded printable ASCII text
preceded and followed by MIME content identifier lines.

The format of the symmetric keys file, ordinarily named `ntp.keys,` is
somewhat different than the other files in the interest of backward
compatibility. Ordinarily, the file is generated by this program, but it
can be constructed and edited using an ordinary text editor.

Figure 1. Typical Symmetric Key File

Figure 1 shows a typical symmetric keys file used by the reference
implementation. Each line of the file contains three fields, first an
integer between 1 and 65534, inclusive, representing the key identifier
used in the `server` and `peer` configuration commands. Next is the key
type for the message digest algorithm, which in the absence of the
OpenSSL library must be `MD5` to designate the MD5 message digest
algorithm. If the OpenSSL library is installed, the key type can be any
message digest algorithm supported by that library. However, if
compatibility with FIPS 140-2 is required, the key type must be either
`SHA` or `SHA1`. The key type can be changed using an ASCII text editor.

An MD5 key consists of a printable ASCII string less than or equal to 16
characters and terminated by whitespace or a # character. An OpenSSL key
consists of a hex-encoded ASCII string of 40 characters, which is
truncated as necessary.

Note that the keys used by the `ntpq` program are checked
against passwords requested by the programs and entered by hand, so it
is generally appropriate to specify these keys in human readable ASCII
format.

The `ntp-keygen` program generates a MD5 symmetric keys file
`ntpkey_MD5key_hostname.filestamp`. Since the file contains private
shared keys, it should be visible only to root and distributed by secure
means to other subnet hosts. The NTP daemon loads the file `ntp.keys`,
so `ntp-keygen` installs a soft link from this name to the generated
file. Subsequently, similar soft links must be installed by manual or
automated means on the other subnet hosts. While this file is not used
with the Autokey Version 2 protocol, it is needed to authenticate some
remote configuration commands used by the link:ntpq.html[`ntpq`] utility.
