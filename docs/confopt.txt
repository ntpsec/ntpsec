[[address]]
== Server and Peer Addresses ==

Following is a description of the server configuration commands in
NTPv4. There are two classes of commands, configuration commands that
configure an association with a remote server, peer or reference clock,
and auxiliary commands that specify environment variables that control
various related operations.

The various modes described on the link:assoc.html[Association
Management] page are determined by the command keyword and the DNS name
or IP address. Addresses are classed by type as (s) a remote server or
peer (IPv4 class A, B and C or IPv6), (b) the IPv4 broadcast address of
a local interface, (m) a multicast address (IPv4 class D or IPv6), or
(r) a reference clock address (127.127.x.x). For type m addresses the
IANA has assigned the multicast group address IPv4 224.0.1.1 and IPv6
ff05::101 (site local) exclusively to NTP, but other nonconflicting
addresses can be used.

If the Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6 (RFC-2553) is
detected, support for the IPv6 address family is generated in addition
to the default IPv4 address family. IPv6 addresses can be identified by
the presence of colons ":" in the address field. IPv6 addresses can be
used almost everywhere where IPv4 addresses can be used, with the
exception of reference clock addresses, which are always IPv4. Note that
in contexts where a host name is expected, a `-4` qualifier preceding
the host name forces DNS resolution to the IPv4 namespace, while a `-6`
qualifier forces DNS resolution to the IPv6 namespace.

[[command]]
== Server Commands ==

Unless noted otherwise, further information about these commands is on
the link:assoc.html[Association Management] page.

`server` 'address' ['options' ...]::
`peer` 'address' ['options' ...]::
`broadcast` 'address' ['options' ...]::
`manycastclient` 'address' ['options' ...]::
`pool` 'address' ['options' ...]::
`unpeer` ['address' | 'associd']::
  These commands specify the remote server name or address to be used
  and the mode in which to operate. The _address_ can be either a DNS
  name or a IPv4 or IPv6 address in standard notation. In general,
  multiple commands of each type can be used for different server and
  peer addresses or multicast groups.
  `server`;;
    For type s and r addresses (only), this command mobilizes a
    persistent client mode association with the specified remote server
    or local reference clock. If the `preempt` flag is specified, a
    preemptable client mode association is mobilized instead.
  `peer`;;
    For type s addresses (only), this command mobilizes a persistent
    symmetric-active mode association with the specified remote peer.
  `broadcast`;;
    For type b and m addressees (only), this command mobilizes a
    broadcast or multicast server mode association. Note that type b
    messages go only to the interface specified, but type m messages go
    to all interfaces.
  `manycastclient`;;
    For type m addresses (only), this command mobilizes a preemptable
    manycast client mode association for the multicast group address
    specified. In this mode the address must match the address specified
    on the `manycastserver` command of one or more designated manycast
    servers. Additional information about this command is on the
    link:discover.html#mcst[Automatic Server Discovery] page.
  `pool`;;
    For type s addresses (only) this command mobilizes a preemptable
    pool client mode association for the DNS name specified. The DNS
    name must resolve to one or more IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. Additional
    information about this command is on the
    link:discover.html#pool[Automatic Server Discovery] page. The
    http://www.pool.ntp.org/[www.pool.ntp.org] page describes a
    compatible pool of public NTP servers.
  `unpeer`;;
    This command removes a previously configured association. An address
    or association ID can be used to identify the association. Either an
    IP address or DNS name can be used. This command is most useful when
    supplied via `ntpq` runtime configuration commands `:config` and
    `config-from-file`.

[[option]]
== Server Command Options ==

`autokey`::
  Send and receive packets authenticated by the Autokey scheme described
  on the link:autokey.html[Autokey Public Key Authentication] page. This
  option is mutually exclusive with the `key` option.
`burst`::
  When the server is reachable, send a burst of packets instead of the
  usual one. This option is valid only with the `server` command and
  type s addresses. It is a recommended option when the `maxpoll` option
  is greater than 10 (1024 s). Additional information about this option
  is on the link:poll.html[Poll Program] page.
`iburst`::
  When the server is unreachable, send a burst of packets instead of the
  usual one. This option is valid only with the `server` command and
  type `s` addresses. It is a recommended option with this command.
  Additional information about this option is on the link:poll.html[Poll
  Program] page.
`ident` 'group'::
  Specify the group name for the association. See the
  link:autokey.html[Autokey Public-Key Authentication] page for further
  information.
`key` 'key'::
  Send and receive packets authenticated by the symmetric key scheme
  described in the link:authentic.html[Authentication Support] page. The
  'key' specifies the key identifier with values from 1 to 65534,
  inclusive. This option is mutually exclusive with the `autokey`
  option.
`minpoll` 'minpoll':: 
`maxpoll` 'maxpoll'::
  These options specify the minimum and maximum poll intervals for NTP
  messages, in seconds as a power of two. The maximum poll interval
  defaults to 10 (1024 s), but can be increased by the `maxpoll` option
  to an upper limit of 17 (36 hr). The minimum poll interval defaults to
  6 (64 s), but can be decreased by the `minpoll` option to a lower
  limit of 3 (8 s). Additional information about this option is on the
  link:poll.html[Poll Program] page.
`mode` 'option'::
  Pass the `option` to a reference clock driver, where `option` is an
  integer in the range from 0 to 255, inclusive. This option is valid
  only with type r addresses.
`noselect`::
  Marks the server or peer to be ignored by the selection algorithm as
  unreachable, but visible to the monitoring program. This option is
  valid only with the `server` and `peer` commands.
`preempt`::
  Specifies the association as preemptable rather than the default
  persistent. This option is ignored with the `broadcast` command and is
  most useful with the `manycastclient` and `pool` commands.
`prefer`::
  Mark the server as preferred. All other things being equal, this host
  will be chosen for synchronization among a set of correctly operating
  hosts. See the link:prefer.html[Mitigation Rules and the `prefer`
  Keyword] page for further information. This option is valid only with
  the `server` and `peer` commands.
`true`::
  Mark the association to assume truechimer status; that is, always
  survive the selection and clustering algorithms. This option can be
  used with any association, but is most useful for reference clocks
  with large jitter on the serial port and precision pulse-per-second
  (PPS) signals. Caution: this option defeats the algorithms designed to
  cast out falsetickers and can allow these sources to set the system
  clock. This option is valid only with the `server` and `peer`
  commands.
`ttl` 'ttl'::
  This option specifies the time-to-live 'ttl' for the `broadcast`
  command and the maximum 'ttl' for the expanding ring search used by
  the `manycastclient` command. Selection of the proper value, which
  defaults to 127, is something of a black art and should be coordinated
  with the network administrator. This option is invalid with type r
  addresses.
`version` 'version'::
  Specifies the version number to be used for outgoing NTP packets.
  Versions 1-4 are the choices, with version 4 the default.
`xleave`::
  Operate in interleaved mode (symmetric and broadcast modes only).
  Further information is on the link:xleave.html[NTP Interleaved Modes]
  page.

[[aux]]
== Auxiliary Commands ==

`broadcastclient`::
  Enable reception of broadcast server messages to any local interface
  (type b address). Ordinarily, upon receiving a broadcast message for
  the first time, the broadcast client measures the nominal server
  propagation delay using a brief client/server exchange, after which it
  continues in listen-only mode. If a nonzero value is specified in the
  `broadcastdelay` command, the value becomes the delay and the volley
  is not executed. Note: the `novolley` option has been deprecated for
  future enhancements. Note that, in order to avoid accidental or
  malicious disruption in this mode, both the server and client should
  operate using symmetric key or public key authentication as described
  in the link:authopt.html[Authentication Options] page. Note that the
  volley is required with public key authentication in order to run the
  Autokey protocol.
`manycastserver` 'address' [...]::
  Enable reception of manycast client messages (type m) to the
  multicasts group address(es) (type m) specified. At least one address
  is required. Note that, in order to avoid accidental or malicious
  disruption, both the server and client should operate using symmetric
  key or public key authentication as described in the
  link:authopt.html[Authentication Options] page.
`multicastclient` 'address' [...]::
  Enable reception of multicast server messages to the multicast group
  address(es) (type m) specified. Upon receiving a message for the first
  time, the multicast client measures the nominal server propagation
  delay using a brief client/server exchange with the server, then
  enters the broadcast client mode, in which it synchronizes to
  succeeding multicast messages. Note that, in order to avoid accidental
  or malicious disruption in this mode, both the server and client
  should operate using symmetric key or public key authentication as
  described in the link:authopt.html[Authentication Options] page.
`mdnstries` 'number'::
  If we are participating in mDNS, after we have synched for the first
  time we attempt to register with the mDNS system. If that registration
  attempt fails, we try again at one minute intervals for up to
  `mdnstries` times. After all, `ntpd` may be starting before mDNS. The
  default value for `mdnstries` is 5.
