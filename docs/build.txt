[[waf]]
=== Autoconf has been replaced with waf ===

The autoconf build system used in NTP Classic has been replaced with
waf, a more modern and much faster build engine.  It is not necessary
to install any separate waf package; the build engine is a Python
script included in your {project-shortname} distribution.

[[build]]
== Building and Installing the Distribution ==

It is not possible in a software distribution such as this to support
every individual computer and operating system with a common
executable, even with the same system but different versions and
options. Therefore, it is necessary to configure, build and install
for each system and version. In almost all cases, these procedures are
completely automatic, The user types `./waf configure`, `./waf build`,
and `./waf install` in that order and the build system does the
rest. There are some exceptions, as noted below and on the
link:hints.html[Hints and Kinks] pages.

This page provides only a general introduction to building the code.
Please consult the INSTALL file in the distribution root for the
most detailed information on build-time dependencies and configuration
options.

[[unix]]
== Building and Installing for Unix ==

This distribution uses common compilers and tools that come with most
Unix distributions. Not all of these tools exist in the standard
distribution of modern Unix versions (compilers are likely to be an
add-on product). If this is the case, consider using the GNU tools and
`gcc` compiler included as freeware in some systems. For a successful
build, all of these tools should be accessible via the current path.

The first thing to do is uncompress the distribution and extract the
source tree. In the distribution base directory use the
`./waf configure` command to perform an automatic configuration procedure.
This command inspects the hardware and software environment and
configures the build process accordingly. Use the `waf` command to
compile and link the distribution and the `install` command to install
the executables by default in `/usr/local/bin`.

If your site supports multiple architectures and uses NFS to share
files, you can use a single source tree to build executables for
multiple architectures. While running on a particular architecture,
change to the base directory and create a subdirectory using a command
like `mkdir A.machine, `which will create an architecture-specific
directory, then change to this directory and mumble `../configure`. The
remaining steps are the same whether building in the base directory or
in the subdirectory.

[[win]]
== Building and Installing for Windows ==

Building for Windows is not presently supported.  This may change in a
future release.  If you have a requirement for this, you may be able
to accelerate the process by contributing either skilled technical
help or money so we can hire skilled technical help.

[[conf]]
== Configuration ==

You are now ready to configure the daemon. You will need to create a NTP
configuration file by default in `/etc/ntp.conf.` Newbies should see the
link:quick.html[Quick Start] page for orientation. Seasoned veterans can
start with the link:ntpd.html[`ntpd` - Network Time Protocol (NTP)
daemon] page and move on to the specific configuration option pages from
there.

[[prob]]
== If You Have Problems ==

If you have problems with your hardware and software environment (e.g.
operating system-specific issues), browse the link:hints.html[Hints and
Kinks] pages. For other problems a tutorial on debugging technique is in
the link:debug.html[NTP Debugging Technique] page. A list of important
system log messages is on the link:msyslog.html[`ntpd` System Log
Messages] page.

The first line of general assistance is the {project-shortname} web site
{project-weblink} and the helpful documents resident
there. Requests for assistance of a general nature and of interest to
other timekeepers should be sent to the NTP newsgroup
comp.protocols.time.ntp.

Users are invited to report bugs and offer suggestions via the
link:bugs.html[NTP Bug Reporting Procedures] page.

[[additional]]
== Additional `waf` commands ==

`./waf clean`::
  Cleans out object files, programs and temporary files.
`./waf distclean`::
  Does the work of `clean`, but cleans out all directories in
  preparation for a new distribution release.
