= Generic NMEA GPS Receiver =

== Synopsis ==

["verse",subs="normal"]
Name: nmea
Reference ID: GPS
Serial Port: /dev/gps__u__; 4800-115200bps, 8N1
Serial Port: /dev/gpspps__u__; for PPS
Features: +tty_clk+

== Description ==

This driver supports GPS receivers with the +$GPRMC+, +$GPGLL+,
+$GPGGA+, +$GPZDA+ and +$GPZDG+ NMEA sentences by default.  Note that
Accord's custom NMEA sentence +$GPZDG+ reports using the GPS timescale,
while the rest of the sentences report UTC.  The difference between the
two is a whole number of seconds which increases with each leap second
insertion in UTC.  To avoid problems mixing UTC and GPS timescales, the
driver disables processing of UTC sentences once +$GPZDG+ is received.

The driver expects the receiver to be set up to transmit at least one
supported sentence every second.

The accuracy depends on the receiver used. Inexpensive GPS models are
available with a claimed PPS signal accuracy of 1 &mu;s or better relative
to the broadcast signal. However, in most cases the actual accuracy is
limited by the precision of the timecode and the latencies of the serial
interface and operating system.

If the operating system supports PPSAPI
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2783.txt[RFC 2783]), the +flag1 1+ option
enables its use.

If there is a /dev/gpspps__u__ it is tried first for PPS, before /dev/gps__u__.

The various GPS sentences that this driver recognises look like this
(others are quietly ignored):

== The \'mode' byte ==

Specific GPS sentences and bitrates may be selected by setting bits of the \'mode' in the refclock configuration line:

|=============================================================================
|Bit    | Decimal | Hex | Meaning
|0      |1        |1    |process +$GPRMC+

|3      |8        |8    |process +$GPZDA+ or +$GPZDG+
|7      |128      |0x80 |
Write the sub-second fraction of the receive time stamp to the clockstat
file for all recognized NMEA sentences. This can be used to get a useful
value for fudge time2
*Caveat:* This will fill your clockstat file rather fast. Use it only
temporarily to get the numbers for the NMEA sentence of your choice.
|8      |256      |0x100|process +$PGRMF+
|9-15   |         |0xFE00   |reserved - leave 0
|16     |65536    |0x10000 | Append extra statistics to the clockstats line. Details below.
|=============================================================================


The default (mode 0) is to process all supported sentences at a
linespeed of 9600 bps, which results in the first one received and
recognized in each cycle being used.  If only specific sentences should
be recognized, then the mode byte must be chosen to enable only the
selected ones.  Multiple sentences may be selected by adding their mode
bit values, but of those enabled still only the first received sentence
in a cycle will be used.  Using more than one sentence per cycle is
impossible, because

* there is only the link:#fudgetime2[time2] option available to compensate
  for transmission delays but every sentence would need a different one

and

* using more than one sentence per cycle overstuffs the internal data
  filters.

The driver uses 9600 bits per second by default, unless
NTPsec was built in Classic strict-compatibility mode, in which
case the old default of 4800bps is used. Faster bitrates can be
selected using the +baud+ option.

*Caveat:* Using higher line speeds does not necessarily increase the
precision of the timing device.  9600 baud is useful to accommodate an
amount of data that does not fit into a 1-second cycle at 4800 bps;
some GPSes (especially when emitting skyview sentences) emit more than
this.  Any device that is exclusively used for time synchronisation
purposes should be configured to transmit the relevant data only,
e.g. one +$GPRMC+ or +$GPZDA+ per second; this will slightly reduce
jitter by reducing variation in transmission times.

== Monitor Data ==

The last GPS sentence that is accepted or rejected is written to the
clockstats file and available with +ntpq -c clockvar+. (Logging the
rejected sentences lets you see/debug why they were rejected.) Filtered
sentences are not logged.

If the 0x10000 mode bit is on and clockstats is enabled, several extra
counters will be appended to the NMEA sentence that gets logged. For
example:

                         checksum or invalid date/time

|10    |0               |Number of PPS pulses used, overrides NMEA sentences
|=============================================================================

The clock identification in field 3 is normally the driver type and
unit, but if your ntpd was built in strict Classic compatibility
mode it will be a magic clock address expressing the same information
in a more opaque way.

Sentences like $GPGSV that don't contain the time will get counted in
the total but otherwise ignored.

http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Support/ConfiguringNMEARefclocks[Configuring
NMEA Refclocks] might give further useful hints for specific hardware
devices that exhibit strange or curious behaviour. Not that it
describes NTP Classic and the old refclock confihuration syntax, and
assumes the old default speed of 4800 baud.

To make a specific setting, select the corresponding decimal values from
the mode byte table, add them all together and enter the resulting
decimal value into the clock configuration line.

== Setting up the Garmin GPS-25XL ==

Switch off all output with by sending it the following string.

-------------------
"$PGRMO,,2<cr><lf>"

Now switch only $GPRMC on by sending it the following string.

On some systems the PPS signal isn't switched on by default. It can be
switched on by sending the following string.

== Known bugs ==

If your GPS has firmware made more than 1024 weeks (19 years and 36
weeks) in the past, its internal date counter will almost certainly
wrap around and generate spurious timestamps.  Beginning in January
2018, newer GPSes may have a longer wraparound (8192 weeks, or 157
years and 28 weeks) but it is not safe to bet that any given receiver
will have firmware updated to take advantage of this.

This problem is fundamental and cannot be compensated for in code
without relying on the accuracy of the local system clock, which
is exactly what an NTP implementation may not do without risking
perverse failure modes (especially at startup time). The only
remedy is not to use ancient GPS hardware.
