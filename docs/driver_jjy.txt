This driver supports the Tristate TS-GPSclock-01 in command/response
subtype, though it is a GPS clock, not JJY radio clock. Using the
menus and the onboard switches, the TS-GPSclock-01 should be set to
command/response mode and JUST time zone.
+
Besides this driver, link:driver_nmea.html[the generic NMEA
GPS driver] supports the TS-GPSclock-01 in NMEA mode.

* [[subtype-100]]Telephone JJY http://jjy.nict.go.jp/ (English and Japanese)
+
The telephone JJY is the time service through a public telephone line. +
The service is provided by the National Institute of Information and
Communications Technology in Japan.
+
ATTENTION; This subtype, the telephone JJY, can not be used with the
refclock_modem driver at the same time. Because the "phone"
statement in the configuration file is not involved with the
"server" statement, so the both the refclock_modem and this
refclock_jjy ( subtype 100 to 180 ) can not recognize the
appropriate "phone" statement among the "phone" statements.
+
NTP configuration ( {ntpconf} )::
+
--
refclock jjy unit X subtype (100, 101 to 180) minpoll N (N >= 8);;
    The subtype 100 is specified, this driver does not issue the loopback
    command in order to measure the delay, and the delay of the
    telephone line and the system processing is not  adjusted.
+
The subtype 101 to 180 is specified, this driver issues the loopback
command and measures the delay of the telephone line and the system
processing through the Telephone JJY loopback circuit.
+
The round trip time through the Telphone JJY loopback circuit is
measured 5 times, and each delay time is greater than 700
milliseconds, that delay time is ignored during average delay time
calculation. Also, if the valid delay time ( <= 700 mS. ) is
measured more than 3 times, the maximum delay time among the valid
delay times is ignored, and if the valid delay time is measured more
than 4 times, the minimum delay time among them is ignored, like
marking/grading sports judgment.
+
The adjustment time is calculated by the formula, multiply ( the
measured round trip time ) by ( ( the subtype number ) - 100 ) %,
and the adjustment delay time is added to the synchronizing time.
+
If you choose the automatic delay adjustment, in other words, the subtype
101 to 180 is specified, the recommended subtype number is 145 to 165.
+
The default polling interval 6 ( 64 seconds ) is too short for this
subtype. The "minpoll" should be set to greater than or equal to 8 ( 256
seconds, about 4 minutes ).
+
The interval time is given the value in second power of 2. The
minpoll value 12 is 4096 seconds interval ( about 1 hour ), 14 is
16384 seconds interval ( about 4.5 hours ), 16 is 65536 seconds (
about 18 hours ), respectively.

flag1 {0|1} flag2 {0|1} flag3 {0|1} flag4 {0|1};;
    Time1 may specify a constant to be added to the time offset for
    the time from the receiver, a fixed-point decimal number in
    seconds.  When the subtype 100 is specified, the time1 may be
    specified in order to adjust the time offset.  When the subtype 101
    to 180 is specified, the time1 should not be specified because
    this driver adds some percentage of the measured loopback delay,
    depending on the value of the subtype number.

   The phone number is available at http://jjy.nict.go.jp/ +
   The number of digits of the phone number is checked. If the
   international access number and the country number are added in
   order to call from outside of Japan, the number of digits is over
   the limit.
+
The first 2 or 3 digits are checked. The emergency service number
and the special service number in Japan are not allowed.
+
Calling from extension line, the number for an outside line should
be prefix "0," ( Zero, Comma ). The prefix is also checked, and no
other outside access number is allowed.

The JJY is the radio station which transmits the JST (Japan Standard
Time) in long wave radio. The station JJY is operated by the National
Institute of Information and Communications Technology. An operating
announcement and some information are available from
http://www.nict.go.jp/ (English and Japanese) and http://jjy.nict.go.jp/
(English and Japanese)

The user is expected to provide a symbolic link to an available serial
port device. This is typically performed by a command such as;

----------------------------------------------------------------
ln -s /dev/ttyS0 /dev/jjy0
----------------------------------------------------------------

Using an RS-232C to USB converter cable, the clock or a modem can be
connected to a USB port instead of a serial port. In this case, the
typical symbolic link command is as follows;

----------------------------------------------------------------
ln -s /dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/jjy0
----------------------------------------------------------------

== Monitor Data ==

The driver writes sent and received data to/from the JJY receivers, GPS
clock, and the modem into the +clockstats+ file.
