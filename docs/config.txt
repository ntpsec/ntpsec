Most modern software distributions include an autoconfigure utility
which customizes the build and install configuration according to the
specific hardware, operating system and file system conventions. For NTP
this utility is called `configure`, which is run before building and
installing the program components. For most installations no additional
actions are required other than running `configure` with no options.
However, it is possible to customize the build and install configuration
through the use of `configure` options.

The available options, together with a concise description, can be
displayed by running `configure` with the `--help` option. Various
options can be used to reduce the memory footprint, adjust the
scheduling priority, enable or disable debugging support or reference
clock driver support. The options can be used to specify where to
install the program components or where to find various libraries if
they are not in the default place.
