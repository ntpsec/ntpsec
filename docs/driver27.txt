== Synopsis ==

["literal",subs="normal"]
Address: 127.127.27.'u'
Reference ID: MSFa / MSF / DCF / WWVB
Driver ID: MSF_ARCRON
Serial Port: /dev/arc__u__; 300 baud, 8-bits, 2-stop, no parity
Features: `tty_clk`

== Description ==

This driver supports the Arcron MSF, DCF and WWVB receivers. The clock
reports its ID as `"MSFa''`, `"MSF''`, `"DCF''` or `"WWVB''` to indicate
the time source.

This documentation describes v1.3 (2003/2/21) of the source and has been
tested against ntpd 4.1.0 on linux x86. Changes from v1.1 and v1.2
include patches to work with the new ntp-4 code, clock support for DCF
and WWVB configurable via mode flag, an option to ignore resync request
(for those of us at the fringes of the WWVB signal, for instance),
averaging of the signal quality poll and several bug fixes, code cleanup
and standardizations. In all other respects, the driver works as per
v1.1 if a mode is not specified.

To use the alternate modes, the mode flag must be specified. If the mode
flag is 0, or unspecified, the original MSF version is assumed. This
should assure backwards compatibility and should not break existing
setups.

The previous documentation described version V1.1 (1997/06/23) of the
source and had been tested (amongst others) against ntpd3-5.90 on
Solaris-1 (SunOS 4.1.3_U1 on an SS1 serving as a router and firewall)
and against ntpd3-5.90 on Solaris-2.5 (on a SS1+ and TurboSPARC 170MHz).
That code will claimed increased stability, reduced jitter and more
efficiency (fewer context switches) with the `tty_clk`
discipline/STREAMS module installed, but this has not been tested. For a
to-do list see the comments at the start of the code.

This code has been significantly slimmed down since the V1.0 version,
roughly halving the memory footprint of its code and data.

This driver is designed to allow the unit to run from batteries as
designed, for something approaching the 2.5 years expected in the usual
stand-alone mode, but no battery-life measurements have been taken.

Much of this code is originally from the other refclock driver files
with thanks. The code was originally made to work with the clock by
mailto:derek@toybox.demon.co.uk[Derek Mulcahy], with modifications by
mailto:d@hd.org[Damon Hart-Davis]. Thanks also to
mailto:lyndond@sentinet.co.uk[Lyndon David] for some of the
specifications of the clock. mailto:palfille@partners.org[Paul Alfille]
added support for the WWVB clock. mailto:cprice@cs-home.com[Christopher
Price] added enhanced support for the MSF, DCF and WWVB clocks.

There is support for a Tcl/Tk monitor written by Derek Mulcahy that
examines the output stats; see the
http://www2.exnet.com/NTP/ARC/ARC.html[ARC Rugby MSF Receiver] page for
more details and the code. Information on the WWVB version is available
from http://www.arctime.com[Atomic Time] as their
http://www.atomictime.com/Product17.html[Atomic Time PC].

Look at the notes at the start of the code for further information; some
of the more important details follow.

The driver interrogates the clock at each poll (ie every 64s by default)
for a timestamp. The clock responds at the start of the next second
(with the start bit of the first byte being on-time). In the default or
original MSF mode, the time is in `local' format, including the daylight
savings adjustment when it is in effect. The driver code converts the
time back to UTC. In modes 1-3 the driver can be configured for UTC or
local time depending on the setting of flag1.

The clock claims to be accurate to within about 20ms of the broadcast
time, and given the low data transmission speed from clock to host, and
the fact that the clock is not in continuous sync with MSF, it seems
sensible to set the 'precision' of this clock to -5 or -4, -4 being used
in this code, which builds in a reported dispersion of over 63ms (ie
says ``This clock is not very good.''). You can improve the reported
precision to -4 (and thus reduce the base dispersion to about 31ms) by
setting the fudge `flag3` to `1`.

Even a busy and slow IP link can yield lower dispersions than this from
polls of primary time servers on the Internet, which reinforces the idea
that this clock should be used as a backup in case of problems with such
an IP link, or in the unfortunate event of failure of more accurate
sources such as GPS.

By default this clock reports itself to be at stratum 2 rather than the
usual stratum 0 for a refclock, because it is not really suited to be
used as other than a backup source. The stratum reported can be changed
with the `stratum` directive to be whatever you like. After careful
monitoring of your clock, and appropriate choice of the `time1` fudge
factor to remove systematic errors in the clock's reported time, you
might fudge the clock to stratum 1 to allow a stratum-2 secondary server
to sync to it.

In default mode, the driver code arranges to resync the clock to MSF at
intervals of a little less than an hour (deliberately avoiding the same
time each hour to avoid any systematic problems with the signal or
host). Whilst resyncing, the driver supplements the normal polls for
time from the clock with polls for the reception signal quality reported
by the clock. If the signal quality is too low (0--2 out of a range of
0--5), we chose not to trust the clock until the next resync (which we
bring forward by about half an hour). If we don't catch the resync, and
so don't know the signal quality, we do trust the clock (because this
would generally be when the signal is very good and a resync happens
quickly), but we still bring the next resync forward and reduce the
reported precision (and thus increase reported dispersion).

If we force resyncs to MSF too often we will needlessly exhaust the
batteries the unit runs from. During clock resync this driver tries to
take enough time samples to avoid `ntpd` losing sync in case this clock
is the current peer. By default the clock would only resync to MSF about
once per day, which would almost certainly not be acceptable for NTP
purposes.

The driver does not force an immediate resync of the clock to MSF when
it starts up to avoid excessive battery drain in case `ntpd` is going to
be repeatedly restarted for any reason, and also to allow enough samples
of the clock to be taken for `ntpd` to sync immediately to this clock
(and not remain unsynchronised or to sync briefly to another configured
peer, only to hop back in a few poll times, causing unnecessary
disturbance). This behaviour should not cause problems because the
driver will not accept the timestamps from the clock if the status flag
delivered with the time code indicates that the last resync attempt was
unsuccessful, so the initial timestamps will be close to reality, even
if with up to a day's clock drift in the worst case (the clock by
default resyncs to MSF once per day).

When alternate modes 1-3 are selected, the driver can be configured to
ignore the resync requests by setting `flag2` to 1. This allows clocks
at the fringe of the signal to resync at night when signals are
stronger.

The clock has a peculiar RS232 arrangement where the transmit lines are
powered from the receive lines, presumably to minimise battery drain.
This arrangement has two consequences:

* Your RS232 interface must drive both +ve and -ve
* You must (in theory) wait for an echo and a further 10ms between
characters

This driver, running on standard Sun and x86 hardware, seems to work
fine; note the use of the `send_slow()` routine to queue up command
characters to be sent once every two seconds.

Three commands are sent to the clock by this driver. Each command
consists of a single letter (of which only the bottom four bits are
significant), followed by a CR (ASCII 13). Each character sent to the
clock should be followed by a delay to allow the unit to echo the
character, and then by a further 10ms. Following the echo of the command
string, there may be a response (ie in the case of the `g` and `o`
commands below), which in the case of the `o` command may be delayed by
up to 1 second so as the start bit of the first byte of the response can
arrive on time. The commands and their responses are:

`g` CR::
    Request for signal quality. Answer only valid during (late part of)
    resync to MSF signal. The response consists of two characters as
    follows:

    bit 7;;
        parity

    bit 6;;
        always 0

    bit 5;;
        always 1

    bit 4;;
        always 1

    bit 3;;
    	always 0

    bit 2;;
    	always 0

    bit 1;;
        always 1

    bit 0;;
    	= 0 if no reception attempt at the moment, = 1 if reception
    	attempt (ie resync) in progress

    bit 7;;
        parity

    bit 6;;
        always 0

    bit 5;;
    	always 1

    bit 4;;
    	always 1

    bit 3;;
    	always 0

    bit 2--0;;
    	reception signal quality in the range 0--5 (very poor to very good); if
	in the range 0--2 no successful reception is to be expected. The
	reported value drops to zero when not resyncing, ie when first returned
	byte is not `3'.

`h` CR::
    Request to resync to signal. Can take up from about 30s to 360s. Drains
    batteries so should not be used excessively. After this the clock time
    and date should be correct and the phase within 20ms of time as
    transmitted from the source signal (remember to allow for propagation
    time). By default the clock resyncs once per day in the late
    evening/early morning (presumably to catch transitions to/from daylight
    saving time quickly). This driver code, by default, resyncs at least
    once per hour to minimise clock wander.

`o` CR::
    Request timestamp. Start bit of first byte of response is on-time, so
    may be delayed up to 1 second. Note that the driver will convert time to
    GMT, if required. The response data is as follows:

The driver only accepts time from the clock if the bottom three bits of
the status byte are `011` or `flag2` is set to 1 to ignore resync
requests. For the MSF clock, if the UK parliament decides to move us to
+0100/+0200 time as opposed to the current +0000/+0100 time, it is not
clear what effect that will have on the time broadcast by MSF, and
therefore on this driver's usefulness.

A typical `ntp.conf` configuration file for this driver might be:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# hostname(n) means we expect (n) to be the stratum at which hostname runs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few `#defineS` in the code that you might wish to play with:

`ARCRON_KEEN`::
   With this defined, the code is relatively trusting of the clock, and
   assumes that you will have the clock as one of a few time sources, so
   will bend over backwards to use the time from the clock when available
   and avoid `ntpd` dropping sync from the clock where possible. You may
   wish to undefine this, especially if you have better sources of time or
   your reception is ropey. However, there are many checks built in even
   with this flag defined.

`ARCRON_MULTIPLE_SAMPLES`::
   When is defined, we regard each character in the returned timecode as at
   a known delay from the start of the second, and use the smallest (most
   negative) offset implied by any such character, ie with the smallest
   kernel-induced display, and use that. This helps to reduce jitter and
   spikes.

`ARCRON_LEAPSECOND_KEEN`::
   When is defined, we try to do a resync to MSF as soon as possible in the
   first hour of the morning of the first day of the first and seventh
   months, ie just after a leap-second insertion or deletion would happen
   if it is going to. This should help compensate for the fact that this
   clock does not continuously sample MSF, which compounds the fact that
   MSF itself gives no warning of an impending leap-second event. This code
   did not seem functional at the leap-second insertion of 30th June 1997
   so is by default disabled.

`PRECISION`::
   Currently set to `-4`, but you may wish to set it to `-5` if you are
   more conservative, or to `-6` if you have particularly good experience
   with the clock and you live on the edge. Note that the `flag3` fudge
   value will improve the reported dispersion one notch if clock signal
   quality is known good. So maybe just leave this alone.

== Monitor Data ==

//ERROR: backticks not recognized around 'clockstats'
Each timecode is written to the `clockstats` file with a signal quality
value appended (`0'--`5' as reported by the clock, or `6' for unknown).

Each resync and result (plus gaining or losing MSF sync) is logged to
the system log at level `LOG_NOTICE`; note that each resync drains the
unit's batteries, so the syslog entry seems justified.

Syslog entries are of the form:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
May 10 10:15:24 oolong ntpd[615]: ARCRON: unit 0: sending resync command
May 10 10:17:32 oolong ntpd[615]: ARCRON: sync finished, signal quality 5: OK, will use clock
May 10 11:13:01 oolong ntpd[615]: ARCRON: unit 0: sending resync command
May 10 11:14:06 oolong ntpd[615]: ARCRON: sync finished, signal quality -1: UNKNOWN, will use clock anyway
May 10 11:41:49 oolong ntpd[615]: ARCRON: unit 0: sending resync command
May 10 11:43:57 oolong ntpd[615]: ARCRON: sync finished, signal quality 5: OK, will use clock
May 10 12:39:26 oolong ntpd[615]: ARCRON: unit 0: sending resync command
May 10 12:41:34 oolong ntpd[615]: ARCRON: sync finished, signal quality 3: OK, will use clock
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Fudge Factors ==

`mode 0 | 1 | 2 | 3`::
   Specifies the clock hardware model. This parameter is optional, it
   defaults to the original mode of operation.
+
Supported modes of operation:
+
0 - Default, Original MSF
+
1 - Updated MSF
+
2 - New DCF77
+
3 - New WWVB

`time1` 'time'::
   Specifies the time offset calibration factor, in seconds and fraction,
   with default 0.0. On a Sun SparcStation 1 running SunOS 4.1.3_U1, with
   the receiver in London, a value of 0.020 (20ms) seems to be appropriate.
`time2` 'time'::
    Not currently used by this driver.
`stratum` 'number'::
   Specifies the driver stratum, in decimal from 0 to 15, with default 2.
   It is suggested that the clock be not be fudged higher than stratum 1 so
   that it is used a backup time source rather than a primary when more
   accurate sources are available.
`refid` 'string'::
   Specifies the driver reference identifier, an ASCII string from one to
   four characters, with default `MSFa`. When used in modes 1-3, the driver
   will report either `MSF`, `DCF`, or `WWVB` respectively.
`flag1 0 | 1`::
   (Modes 1-3) If set to 0 (the default), the clock is set to UTC time. If
   set to 1, the clock is set to localtime.
`flag2 0 | 1`::
   (Modes 1-3) If set to 0 (the default), the clock will be forced to
   resync approximately every hour. If set to 1, the clock will resync per
   normal operations (approximately midnight).
`flag3 0 | 1`::
   If set to 1, better precision is reported (and thus lower dispersion)
   while clock's received signal quality is known to be good.
`flag4 0 | 1`
   Not used by this driver.
