NTP has been under development for almost 30 years, but the paint ain't
dry even now. This release of the NTP Version 4 (NTPv4) distribution for
Unix, VMS and Windows incorporates new features and refinements, but
retaining backwards compatibility with older versions, including NTPv3
and NTPv2, but not NTPv1. Support for NTPv1 has been discontinued
because of certain security vulnerabilities.

[[new]]
== New Features ==

* The behavior of the daemon at startup has been considerably improved.
The time to measure the frequency and correct an initial offset error
when started for the first time is now no more than ten minutes. Upon
restart, it takes no more than five minutes to reduce the initial offset
to less than one millisecond without adversely affecting the frequency.
This avoids a subsequent frequency correction which could take up to
several hours.
* A new feature called interleaved mode can be used in NTP symmetric and
broadcast modes. It is designed to improve accuracy by minimizing errors
due to queuing and transmission delays. It is described on the
link:xleave.html[NTP Interleaved Modes] page.
* The huff-n'-puff filter is designed to avoid large errors with DSL
circuits and highly asymmetrical traffic, as when downloading large
files. Details are on the link:huffpuff.html[The Huff-n'-Puff Filter]
page.
* A new feature called orphan mode provides an automatic, subnet-wide
synchronization feature with multiple sources. It provides reliable
backup in isolated networks or in pr when Internet sources have become
unavailable. See the link:orphan.html[Orphan Mode] page for further
information.
* This release includes comprehensive packet rate management tools to
help reduce the level of spurious network traffic and protect the
busiest servers from overload. There is support for the optional
Kiss-o'-Death (KoD) packet intended to slow down an abusive client. See
the link:rate.html[Rate Management and the Kiss-o'-Death Packet] page
for further information.
* There are two new burst mode features available where special
conditions apply. One of these is enabled by the `iburst` keyword in the
`server` configuration command. It is intended for cases where it is
important to set the clock quickly when an association is first
mobilized. The other is enabled by the `burst` keyword in the `server`
configuration command. It is intended for cases where the network
attachment requires an initial calling or training procedure. See the
link:assoc.html[Association Management] page for further information.
* The OpenSSL cryptographic library has replaced the library formerly
available from RSA Laboratories. All cryptographic routines except a
version of the MD5 message digest algorithm have been removed from the
base distribution. All 128-bit and 160-bit message digests algorithms
are now supported for both symmetric key and public key cryptosystems.
See the link:authentic.html[Authentication Support] page for further
information and the link:authopt.html[Authentication Options] page for a
list of supported digest algorithms.
* This release includes support for Autokey public-key cryptography for
authenticating public servers to clients, as described in RFC 5906. This
support requires the --enable-autokey option when building the
distribution, which is the default is OpenSSL is available. The
deployment of Autokey subnets is now considerably simpler than in
earlier versions. A subnet naming scheme is now available to filter
manycast and pool configurations. Additional information about Autokey
is on the link:autokey.html[Autokey Public Key Authentication] page and
links from there.
* The NTP descrete even simulator has been substantially upgraded, now
including scenarios with multiple servers and time-sensitive scripts.
This allows the NTP algorithms to be tested in an embedded environment
with systematic and pseudo-random network delay and oscillator wander
distributions. This has been used to verify correct operation under
conditions of extreme error and misconfiguration. See the
link:ntpdsim.html[`ntpdsim` - Network Time Protocol (NTP) simulator]
page. A technical description and performance analysis is given in the
white papers at the http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp.html[NTP
Project Page].
* NTPv4 includes three new server discovery schemes, which in most
applications can avoid per-host configuration altogether. Two of these
are based on IP multicast technology, while the remaining one is based
on crafted DNS lookups. See the link:discover.html[Automatic NTP
Configuration Schemes] page for further information.
* The status display and event report monitoring functions have been
considerably expanded, including new statistics files and event
reporting to files and the system log. See the link:decode.html[Event
Messages and Status Words] page for further information.
* Several new options have been added for the `ntpd` command line. For
the inveterate knob twiddlers several of the more important performance
variables can be changed to fit actual or perceived special conditions.
In particular, the `tinker` and `tos` commands can be used to adjust
thresholds, throw switches and change limits.
* The `ntpd` daemon can be operated in a one-time mode similar to
`ntpdate`, which program is headed for retirement. See the
link:ntpd.html[`ntpd` - Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon] page for the
new features.
* A number of white papers have been added to the library on the NTP

[[change]]
== Changes and Upgrades Since the NTPv3 Version (xntp3-5) ==

This section summarizes general changes since the publication of
RFC-1305. Specific changes made during the code upgrade of 2007-2008 are
summarized in link:history.html[Historical Notes].

* If the Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6 (RFC-2553) is
detected, support for the IPv6 address family is supported in addition
to the default support for the IPv4 address family. In contexts where a
host name is expected, a `-4` qualifier preceding the host name forces
DNS resolution to the IPv4 namespace, while a `-6` qualifier forces DNS
resolution to the IPv6 namespace.
* Many changes have been made in the NTP algorithms to improve
performance and reliability A clock state machine has been incorporated
to improve behavior under transient conditions. The clock discipline
algorithm has been redesigned to improve accuracy, reduce the impact of
network disruptions and allow increased poll intervals to 36 hours with
only moderate sacrifice in accuracy. The clock select, cluster and
combine algorithms have been overhauled as the result of a thorough
statistical analysis.
* In all except a very few cases, all timing intervals are randomized,
so that the tendency for NTPv3 to self-synchronize and bunch messages,
especially with a large number of configured associations, is minimized.
* Support for the precision time kernel modifications, which are now in
stock FreeBSD and optional in Linux kernels, is included. With this
support the system clock can be disciplined to the order of one
nanosecond. The older microtime kernel modifications in
Digital/Compaq/HP Tru64, Digital Ultrix and Sun Microsystems SunOS and
Solaris, continue to be supported. In either case the support eliminates
sawtooth error, which can be in the hundreds of microseconds. Further
information is on the link:kern.html[Kernel Model for Precision
Timekeeping] page.
* New reference clock drivers have been added for several GPS receivers
now on the market for a total of 44 drivers. The reference clock driver
interface is smaller, more rational, more flexible and more accurate.
Most of the drivers in NTPv3 have been converted to the NTPv4 interface
and continue to operate as before. A summary of the supported drivers is
on the link:refclock.html[Reference Clock Support] page. Audio drivers
for the Canadian standard time and frequency station CHU, the US
standard time and frequency stations WWV/H and for IRIG signals have
been updated and capabilities added to allow direct connection of these
signals to an audio port. See the link:audio.html[Reference Clock Audio
Drivers] page for further information.
* Support for pulse-per-second (PPS) signals has been extended to all
drivers as an intrinsic function. Further information is on the
link:pps.html[Pulse-Per-Second (PPS) Signal Interfacing] page. Typical
performance with the PPS interface and a fast machine are in the low
microseconds.
* Several small changes have been made to make administration and
maintenance more convenience. The entire distribution has been converted
to gnu `automake`, which greatly ease the task of porting to new and
different programming environments, as well as reduce the incidence of
bugs due to improper handling of idiosyncratic kernel functions. Version
control is provided by Bitkeeper using an online repository at
www.ntp.org. Trouble ticket reporting is provided using Bugzilla. If
`ntpd`, is configured with NetInfo support, it will attempt to read its
configuration from the NetInfo service if the default `ntp.conf` file
cannot be read and no file is specified by the `-c` option. When `ntpd`
starts it looks at the value of `umask`, and if zero `ntpd` will set the
`umask` to `022`.

[[nasty]]
== Nasty Surprises ==

There are a few things different about this release that have changed
since the latest NTP Version 3 release. Following are a few things to
worry about:

* Some configuration commands have been removed, others added and some
changed in minor ways. See the Commands and Options collection on the
link:sitemap.html[Site Map] page.
* When both IPv4 and IPv6 address families are in use, the host's
resolver library may not choose the intended address family if a server
has an IPv4 and IPv6 address associated with the same DNS name. The
solution is to use the IPv4 or IPv6 address directly in such cases or
use another DNS name that resolves to the intended address family. Older
versions of `ntpdc` will show only the IPv4 associations with the
`peers` and some other commands. Older versions of `ntpq` will show
0.0.0.0 for IPv6 associations with the `peers` and some other commands.
* There is a minor change to the reference ID field of the NTP packet
header when operating with IPv6 associations. In IPv4 associations this
field contains the 32-bit IPv4 address of the server, in order to detect
and avoid loops. In IPv6 associations this field contains the first
32-bits of a MD5 hash formed from the IPv6 address. All programs in the
distribution have been modified to work with both address families.
* The `tty_clk` and `ppsclock` pulse-per-second (PPS) line
discipline/streams modules are no longer supported. The PPS function is
now handled by the link:driver22.html[PPS Clock Discipline]
driver, which uses the new PPSAPI application program interface adopted
by the IETF. Note that the `pps` configuration file command has been
obsoleted by the driver. See the link:pps.html[Pulse-Per-Second (PPS)
Signal Interfacing] page for further information.
* Support for the NTPv1 symmetric mode has been discontinued, since it
hasn't worked for years. Support continues for the NTPv1 client mode,
which is used by some SNTP clients.
* The `authstuff` directory, intended as a development and testing aid
for porting cryptographic routines to exotic architectures, has been
removed. Testing and conformance validation tools are available in the
OpenSSL software distribution.
