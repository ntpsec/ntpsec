== Synopsis ==

["literal",subs="normal"]
Address: 127.127.22.'u'
Reference ID: PPS
Driver ID: PPS
Serial or Parallel Port: /dev/pps__u__
Requires: PPSAPI signal interface for PPS signal processing.

Note: This driver supersedes an older one of the same name. The older
driver operated with several somewhat archaic signal interface
devices, required intricate configuration and was poorly
documented. This driver requires the Pulse per Second API
(PPSAPI)^1^. Note also that the `pps` configuration
command has been obsoleted by this driver.

== Description ==

This driver furnishes an interface for the pulse-per-second (PPS) signal
produced by a cesium clock, radio clock or related devices. It can be
used to augment the serial timecode generated by a GPS receiver, for
example. It can be used to remove accumulated jitter and re-time a
secondary server when synchronized to a primary server over a congested,
wide-area network and before redistributing the time to local clients.
The driver includes extensive signal sanity checks and grooming
algorithms. A range gate and frequency discriminator reject noise and
signals with incorrect frequency. A multiple-stage median filter rejects
jitter due to hardware interrupt and operating system latencies. A
trimmed-mean algorithm determines the best time samples. With typical
workstations and processing loads, the incidental jitter can be reduced
to a few microseconds.

While this driver can discipline the time and frequency relative to the
PPS source, it cannot number the seconds. For this purpose an auxiliary
source is required, ordinarily a radio clock operated as a primary
reference (stratum 1) source; however, another NTP time server can be
used as well. For this purpose, the auxiliary source should be specified
as the prefer peer, as described in the link:prefer.html[Mitigation
Rules and the `prefer` Keyword] page.

The driver requires the PPSAPI interface^1^, which is a proposed IETF
standard. The interface consists of the `timepps.h` header file and
associated kernel support. Support for this interface is included in
current versions of Solaris, FreeBSD and Linux and proprietary versions
of Tru64 (Alpha) and SunOS. See the link:pps.html[Pulse-per-second
(PPS) Signal Interfacing] page for further information.

The PPS source can be connected via a serial or parallel port, depending
on the hardware and operating system. A serial port can be dedicated to
the PPS source or shared with another device; however, if dedicated the
data leads should not be connected, as noise or unexpected signals can
cause `ntpd` to exit.

A radio clock is usually connected via a serial port and the PPS source
connected via a level converter to the data carrier detect (DCD) pin
(DB-9 pin 1, DB-25 pin 8) of the same connector. In some systems where a
parallel port and driver are available, the PPS signal can be connected
directly to the ACK pin (DB25 pin 10) of the connector. Whether the PPS
signal is connected via a dedicated port or shared with another device,
the driver opens the device `/dev/pps%d`, where `%d` is the unit number.
As with other drivers, links can be used to redirect the logical name to
the actual physical device.

The driver normally operates like any other driver and uses the same
mitigation algorithms and PLL/FLL clock discipline incorporated in the
daemon. If kernel PLL/FLL support is available, the kernel PLL/FLL clock
discipline can be used instead. The default behavior is not to use the
kernel PPS clock discipline, even if present. This driver incorporates a
good deal of signal processing to reduce jitter using the median filter
algorithm in the driver. As the result, performance with `minpoll`
configured at 4 (16s) is generally better than the kernel PPS
discipline. However, fudge flag 3 can be used to enable the kernel PPS
discipline if necessary.

This driver is enabled only under one of two conditions (a) a prefer
peer other than this driver is among the survivors of the mitigation
algorithms or (b) there are no survivors and the `minsane` option of the
`tos` command is 0. The prefer peer designates another source that can
reliably number the seconds when available . However, if no sources are
available, the system clock continues to be disciplined by the PPS
driver on an indefinite basis.

A scenario where the latter behavior can be most useful is a planetary
orbiter fleet, for instance in the vicinity of Mars, where contact
between orbiters and Earth only one or two times per Sol (Mars day).
These orbiters have a precise timing reference based on an Ultra Stable
Oscillator (USO) with accuracy in the order of a Cesium oscillator. A
PPS signal is derived from the USO and can be disciplined from Earth on
rare occasion or from another orbiter via NTP. In the above scenario the
PPS signal disciplines the spacecraft clock between NTP updates.

In a similar scenario a PPS signal can be used to discipline the clock
between updates produced by the modem driver. This would provide precise
synchronization without needing the Internet at all.

== Fudge Factors ==

`time1` 'time'::
  Specifies the time offset calibration factor, in seconds and fraction,
  with default 0.0.
`time2` 'time'::
  Not used by this driver.
`stratum` 'number'::
  Specifies the driver stratum, in decimal from 0 to 15, with default 0.
`refid` 'string'::
  Specifies the driver reference identifier, an ASCII string from one to
  four characters, with default `PPS`.
`flag1 0 | 1`::
  Not used by this driver.
`flag2 0 | 1`::
  Specifies PPS capture on the rising (assert) pulse edge if 0 (default)
  or falling (clear) pulse edge if 1. Not used under Windows - if the
  special `serialpps.sys` serial port driver is installed then the
  leading edge will _always_ be used.
`flag3 0 | 1`::
  Controls the kernel PPS discipline: 0 for disable (default), 1 for
  enable. Not used under Windows - if the special `serialpps.sys<\tt>
  serial port driver is used then kernel PPS will be available and
  used.
`flag4 0 | 1`::
  Record a timestamp once for each second if 1. Useful for constructing
  Allan deviation plots.
