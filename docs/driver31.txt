== Synopsis ==

["literal",subs="normal"]
Address: 127.127.31.'u'
Reference ID: GPS
Driver ID: JUPITER
Serial Port: `/dev/gps`__u__; 9600 baud, 8-bits, no parity.

== Description ==

This driver supports at least some models of the
http://www.navman.com/oem/products/receivers/jupiter/[Rockwell Jupiter
`GPS` receivers] (Jupiter 11, Jupiter-T), they must at least support the
_Zodiac Binary Protocol_.

The driver requires a standard `PPS` interface for the pulse-per-second
output from the receiver. The serial data stream alone does not provide
precision time stamps, whereas the PPS output is precise down to 40 ns
(1 sigma) for the Jupiter 11 and 25 ns (1 sigma) for Jupiter-T according
to the documentation. If you do not have the PPS signal available, then
you should probably not be using the Jupiter receiver as a time source.
This driver requires a `PPS` signal and the time output from Jupiter
receivers is not predictable in `NMEA` mode; the reported time can take
one second steps.

== Monitor Data ==

The driver always puts a lot of useful information on the clockstats
file, and when run with debugging can be quite chatty on stdout. When
first starting to use the driver you should definitely review the
information written to the clockstats file to verify that the driver is
running correctly.

== Fudge Factors ==

`time1` 'time'::
   Specifies the time offset calibration factor, in seconds and fraction,
   with default 0.0.
`time2` 'time'::
   Not used by this driver. Should be left at zero.
`stratum` 'number'::
   Specifies the driver stratum, in decimal from 0 to 15, with default 0.
`refid` 'string'::
   Specifies the driver reference identifier, an `ASCII` string from one to
   four characters, with default `GPS`.
`flag1 0 | 1`::
   Not used by this driver.
`flag2 0 | 1`::
   Specifies the mobility of the `GPS` receiver: 0 for walking (default), 1
   for driving.
`flag3 0 | 1`::
   Specifies the `PPS` signal on-time edge: 0 for assert (default), 1 for
   clear.
`flag4 0 | 1`::
   Not used by this driver.

== Additional Information ==

The driver was resurrected from a sorry state using the Windows NT port
and a Jupiter 11, and has since seen little testing on other platforms.
On Windows there exist a barrier though, as there is no publicly
available `PPSAPI` implementation, at least not to my knowledge.
However, there has been one success report using Linux 2.4.20 and PPSkit
2.1.1.

//FIXME: SiRF has not sold any Rockwells since at least 2006
The Jupiter receivers seem to have quite a few names. They are referred
to at least as Rockwell receivers, Navman receivers, Zodiac receivers,
Conexant receivers and SiRF Technology receivers. Rockwell seems to be
the original and most commonly used name and Navman seems to be the
current supplier.

=== Configuration ===

//FIXME: Backticks and quotes not rendering properly
The edge of the `PPS` signal that is `on-time' can be set with `flag2`.
There is currently no way to cause the `PPS` signal to control the
kernel `PLL`.

=== Performance ===

The performance is largely unexplored. I have achieved submillisecond
stability using a Jupiter 11, but the poor result is more than likely
due to the proprietary `PPSAPI` implementation or Windows itself.

This driver does not handle leap seconds.
