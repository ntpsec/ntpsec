The clock cluster algorithm processes the truechimers produced by the
clock select algorithm to produce a list of _survivors_. These survivors
are used by the mitigation algorithms to discipline the system clock.
The cluster algorithm operates in a series of rounds, where at each
round the truechimer furthest from the offset centroid is pruned from
the population. The rounds are continued until a specified termination
condition is met. This page discusses the algorithm in detail.

First, the truechimer associations are saved on an unordered list with
each candidate entry identified with index __i__ (__i__ = 1, ..., __n)__,
where __n__ is the number of candidates. Let θ(__i__), be the offset and
λ(__i__) be the root distance of the __i__th entry. Recall that the root
distance is equal to the root dispersion plus half the root delay. For
the __i__th candidate on the list, a statistic called the _select jitter_
relative to the __i__th candidate is calculated as follows. Let

__d~i~__(__j__) = |θ(__j__) − θ(__i__)| λ(__i__),

where θ(__i)__ is the peer offset of the __i__th entry and θ(__j__) is the
peer offset of the __j__th entry, both produced by the clock filter
algorithm. The metric used by the cluster algorithm is the select jitter
φ~S~(__i__) computed as the root mean square (RMS) of the __d~i~__(__j__) as
__j__ ranges from 1 to __n__. For the purpose of notation in the example
to follow, let φ~R~(__i__) be the peer jitter computed by the clock filter
algorithm for the __i__th candidate.

The object at each round is to prune the entry with the largest metric
until the termination condition is met. Note that the select jitter must
be recomputed at each round, but the peer jitter does not change. At
each round the remaining entries on the list represent the survivors of
that round. If the candidate to be pruned is preemptable and the number
of candidates is greater than the _maxclock_ _threshold_, the association
is demobilized. This is useful in the schemes described on the
link:discover.html[Automatic Server Discovery Schemes] page. The
maxclock threshold default is 10, but it can be changed using the
+maxclock+ option of the link:miscopt.html#tos[+tos+] command. Further
pruning is subject to the following termination conditions, but no
associations will be automatically demobilized.

The termination condition has two parts. First, if the number of
survivors is not greater than the _minclock_ _threshold_ set by the
+minclock+ option of the link:miscopt.html#tos[+tos+] command, the
pruning process terminates. The _minclock_ default is 3, but can be
changed to fit special conditions, as described on the
link:prefer.html[Mitigation Rules and the prefer Keyword] page.

Figure 1. Cluster Algorithm

The second termination condition is more intricate. Figure 1 shows a
round where a candidate of (a) is pruned to yield the candidates of (b).
Let φ~max~ be the maximum select jitter and φ~min~ be the minimum
peer jitter over all candidates on the list. In (a), candidate 1 has the
highest select jitter, so φ~_max_~ = φ~S~(1). Candidate 4 has the lowest
peer jitter, so φ~min~ = φ~R~(4). Since φ~max~ > φ~min~, select
jitter dominates peer jitter, the algorithm prunes candidate 1. In (b),
φ~max~ = φ~S~(3) and φ~min~ =φ~R~(4). Since φ~max~ < φ~min~,
pruning additional candidates does not reduce select jitter, the
algorithm terminates with candidates 2, 3 and 4 as survivors.

The survivor list is passed on to the mitigation algorithms, which
combine the survivors, select a system peer, and compute the system
statistics passed on to dependent clients. Note the use of root distance
λ as a weight factor at each round in the clock cluster algorithm. This
is to favor the survivors with the lowest root distance and thus the
smallest maximum error.
