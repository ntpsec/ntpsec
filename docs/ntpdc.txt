== Synopsis ==

["literal",subs="normal"]
ntpdc [ -46dilnps ] [ -c 'command' ] [ 'host' ] [ . . . ]

== Description ==

`ntpdc` is deprecated - please use `ntpq` now, as it uses a more sane
interface and can provide all of the information that `ntpdc` used to
provide.

`ntpdc` is used to query the `ntpd` daemon about its current state and
to request changes in that state. The program may be run either in
interactive mode or controlled using command line arguments. Extensive
state and statistics information is available through the `ntpdc`
interface. In addition, nearly all the configuration options which can
be specified at startup using ntpd's configuration file may also be
specified at run time using `ntpdc`.

If one or more request options are included on the command line when
`ntpdc` is executed, each of the requests will be sent to the NTP
servers running on each of the hosts given as command line arguments, or
on localhost by default. If no request options are given, `ntpdc` will
attempt to read commands from the standard input and execute these on
the NTP server running on the first host given on the command line,
again defaulting to localhost when no other host is specified. `ntpdc`
will prompt for commands if the standard input is a terminal device.

`ntpdc` uses NTP mode 7 packets to communicate with the NTP server, and
hence can be used to query any compatible server on the network which
permits it. Note that since NTP is a UDP protocol this communication
will be somewhat unreliable, especially over large distances in terms of
network topology. `ntpdc` makes no attempt to retransmit requests, and
will time requests out if the remote host is not heard from within a
suitable timeout time.

The operation of `ntpdc` are specific to the particular implementation
of the `ntpd` daemon and can be expected to work only with this and
maybe some previous versions of the daemon. Requests from a remote
`ntpdc` program which affect the state of the local server must be
authenticated, which requires both the remote program and local server
share a common key and key identifier.

Note that in contexts where a host name is expected, a `-4` qualifier
preceding the host name forces DNS resolution to the IPv4 namespace,
while a `-6` qualifier forces DNS resolution to the IPv6 namespace.

== Command Line Options ==

Specifying a command line option other than `-i` or `-n` will cause the
specified query (queries) to be sent to the indicated host(s)
immediately. Otherwise, `ntpdc` will attempt to read interactive format
commands from the standard input.

`-4`::
  Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line to
  the IPv4 namespace.
`-6`::
  Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line to
  the IPv6 namespace.
`-c` 'command'::
  The following argument is interpreted as an interactive format command
  and is added to the list of commands to be executed on the specified
  host(s). Multiple -c options may be given.
`-d` ::
  Turn on debugging mode.
`-i`::
  Force `ntpdc` to operate in interactive mode. Prompts will be written
  to the standard output and commands read from the standard input.
`-l`::
  Obtain a list of peers which are known to the server(s). This switch
  is equivalent to `-c listpeers`.
`-n`::
  Output all host addresses in dotted-quad numeric format rather than
  converting to the canonical host names.
`-p`::
  Print a list of the peers known to the server as well as a summary of
  their state. This is equivalent to `-c peers`.
`-s`::
  Print a list of the peers known to the server as well as a summary of
  their state, but in a slightly different format than the -p switch.
  This is equivalent to `-c dmpeers`.

== Interactive Commands ==

Interactive format commands consist of a keyword followed by zero to
four arguments. Only enough characters of the full keyword to uniquely
identify the command need be typed. The output of a command is normally
sent to the standard output, but optionally the output of individual
commands may be sent to a file by appending a `<`, followed by a file
name, to the command line.

A number of interactive format commands are executed entirely within the
`ntpdc` program itself and do not result in NTP mode 7 requests being
sent to a server. These are described following.

`? [` _`command_keyword`_ `]`::
`help [` _`command_keyword`_ `]`::
  A `?` by itself will print a list of all the command keywords known to
  this incarnation of `ntpq`. A `?` followed by a command keyword will
  print function and usage information about the command. This command
  is probably a better source of information about `ntpq` than this
  manual page.
`delay` 'milliseconds'::
  Specify a time interval to be added to timestamps included in requests
  which require authentication. This is used to enable (unreliable)
  server reconfiguration over long delay network paths or between
  machines whose clocks are unsynchronized. Actually the server does not
  now require timestamps in authenticated requests, so this command may
  be obsolete.
`host` 'hostname'::
  Set the host to which future queries will be sent. Hostname may be
  either a host name or a numeric address.
`hostnames [ yes | no ]`::
  If `yes` is specified, host names are printed in information displays.
  If `no` is specified, numeric addresses are printed instead. The
  default is `yes`, unless modified using the command line `-n` switch.
`keyid` 'keyid'::
  This command allows the specification of a key number to be used to
  authenticate configuration requests from ntpdc to the host(s). This
  must correspond to a key number which the host/server has been
  configured to use for this purpose (server options: `trustedkey`, and
  `requestkey`). If authentication is not enabled on the host(s) for
  ntpdc commands, the command `"keyid 0"` should be given; otherwise the
  _keyid_ of the next subsequent `addpeer/addserver/broadcast` command
  will be used.
`quit`::
  Exit `ntpdc`.
`passwd`::
  This command prompts you to type in a password (which will not be
  echoed) which will be used to authenticate configuration requests. The
  password must correspond to the key configured for use by the NTP
  server for this purpose if such requests are to be successful.
`timeout` 'milliseconds'::
  Specify a timeout period for responses to server queries. The default
  is about 8000 milliseconds. Note that since `ntpdc` retries each query
  once after a timeout, the total waiting time for a timeout will be
  twice the timeout value set.

== Control Message Commands ==

Query commands result in NTP mode 7 packets containing requests for
information being sent to the server. These are read-only commands in
that they make no modification of the server configuration state.

`listpeers`::
  Obtains and prints a brief list of the peers for which the server is
  maintaining state. These should include all configured peer
  associations as well as those peers whose stratum is such that they
  are considered by the server to be possible future synchronization
  candidates.
`peers`::
  Obtains a list of peers for which the server is maintaining state,
  along with a summary of that state. Summary information includes the
  address of the remote peer, the local interface address (0.0.0.0 if a
  local address has yet to be determined), the stratum of the remote
  peer (a stratum of 16 indicates the remote peer is unsynchronized),
  the polling interval, in seconds, the reachability register, in octal,
  and the current estimated delay, offset and dispersion of the peer,
  all in seconds.
+
The character in the left margin indicates the mode this peer entry is
operating in. A `+` denotes symmetric active, a `-` indicates
symmetric passive, a `=` means the remote server is being polled in
client mode, a `^` indicates that the server is broadcasting to this
address, a `~` denotes that the remote peer is sending broadcasts and
a `*` marks the peer the server is currently synchronizing to.
+
The contents of the host field may be one of four forms. It may be a
host name, an IP address, a reference clock implementation name with
its parameter or `REFCLK(implementation number, parameter)`. On
`hostnames no` only IP-addresses will be displayed.

`dmpeers`::
  A slightly different peer summary list. Identical to the output of the
  `peers` command, except for the character in the leftmost column.
  Characters only appear beside peers which were included in the final
  stage of the clock selection algorithm. A `.` indicates that this peer
  was cast off in the falseticker detection, while a `+` indicates that
  the peer made it through. A `*` denotes the peer the server is
  currently synchronizing with.
`showpeer` 'peer_address' `[...]`::
  Shows a detailed display of the current peer variables for one or more
  peers. Most of these values are described in the NTP Version 2
  specification.
`pstats` 'peer_address' `[...]`::
  Show per-peer statistic counters associated with the specified
  peer(s).
`clockstat` 'clock_peer_address' `[...]`::
  Obtain and print information concerning a peer clock. The values
  obtained provide information on the setting of fudge factors and other
  clock performance information.
`kerninfo`::
  Obtain and print kernel phase-lock loop operating parameters. This
  information is available only if the kernel has been specially
  modified for a precision timekeeping function.
`loopinfo [ oneline | multiline ]`::
  Print the values of selected loop filter variables. The loop filter is
  the part of NTP which deals with adjusting the local system clock. The
  `offset` is the last offset given to the loop filter by the packet
  processing code. The `frequency` is the frequency error of the local
  clock in parts-per-million (ppm). The `time_const` controls the
  stiffness of the phase-lock loop and thus the speed at which it can
  adapt to oscillator drift. The `watchdog timer` value is the number of
  seconds which have elapsed since the last sample offset was given to
  the loop filter. The `oneline` and `multiline` options specify the
  format in which this information is to be printed, with `multiline` as
  the default.
`sysinfo`::
  Print a variety of system state variables, i.e., state related to the
  local server. All except the last four lines are described in the NTP
  Version 3 specification, RFC-1305.
+
The `system flags` show various system flags, some of which can be set
and cleared by the `enable` and `disable` configuration commands,
respectively. These are the `auth`, `bclient`, `monitor`, `pll`, `pps`
and `stats` flags. See the `ntpd` documentation for the meaning of
these flags. There are two additional flags which are read only, the
`kernel_pll` and `kernel_pps`. These flags indicate the
synchronization status when the precision time kernel modifications
are in use. The `kernel_pll` indicates that the local clock is being
disciplined by the kernel, while the kernel_pps indicates the kernel
discipline is provided by the PPS signal.
+
Note that some directives, like `enable pps`, are only supported on
certain versions of `ntpd`.
+
The `stability` is the residual frequency error remaining after the
system frequency correction is applied and is intended for maintenance
and debugging. In most architectures, this value will initially
decrease from as high as 500 ppm to a nominal value in the range .01
to 0.1 ppm. If it remains high for some time after starting the
daemon, something may be wrong with the local clock, or the value of
the kernel variable `tick` may be incorrect.
+
The `broadcastdelay` shows the default broadcast delay, as set by the
`broadcastdelay` configuration command.
+
The `authdelay` shows the default authentication delay, as set by the
`authdelay` configuration command.

`sysstats`::
  Print statistics counters maintained in the protocol module.
`memstats`::
  Print statistics counters related to memory allocation code.
`iostats`::
  Print statistics counters maintained in the input-output module.
`timerstats`::
  Print statistics counters maintained in the timer/event queue support
  code.
`reslist`::
  Obtain and print the server's restriction list. This list is (usually)
  printed in sorted order and may help to understand how the
  restrictions are applied.
`ifstats`::
  List interface statistics for interfaces used by ntpd for network
  communication.
`ifreload`::
  Force rescan of current system interfaces. Outputs interface
  statistics for interfaces that could possibly change. Marks unchanged
  interfaces with *.*, added interfaces with *+* and deleted interfaces
  with *-*.
`monlist` [ 'version' ]::
  Obtain and print traffic counts collected and maintained by the
  monitor facility. The version number should not normally need to be
  specified. At most, 600 entries are displayed by `monlist`. To display
  the entire MRU list, use the `ntpq` program's
  link:ntpq.html#mrulist[`mrulist`] command.
`clkbug` 'clock_peer_address' `[...]`::
  Obtain debugging information for a reference clock driver. This
  information is provided only by some clock drivers and is mostly
  undecodable without a copy of the driver source in hand.

== Runtime Configuration Requests ==

All requests which cause state changes in the server are authenticated
by the server using a configured NTP key (the facility can also be
disabled by the server by not configuring a key). The key number and the
corresponding key must also be made known to `ntpdc`. This can be done
using the keyid and passwd commands, the latter of which will prompt at
the terminal for a password to use as the encryption key. You will also
be prompted automatically for both the key number and password the first
time a command which would result in an authenticated request to the
server is given. Authentication not only provides verification that the
requester has permission to make such changes, but also gives an extra
degree of protection again transmission errors.

Authenticated requests always include a timestamp in the packet data,
which is included in the computation of the authentication code. This
timestamp is compared by the server to its receive time stamp. If they
differ by more than a small amount the request is rejected. This is done
for two reasons. First, it makes simple replay attacks on the server, by
someone who might be able to overhear traffic on your LAN, much more
difficult. Second, it makes it more difficult to request configuration
changes to your server from topologically remote hosts. While the
reconfiguration facility will work well with a server on the local host,
and may work adequately between time-synchronized hosts on the same LAN,
it will work very poorly for more distant hosts. As such, if reasonable
passwords are chosen, care is taken in the distribution and protection
of keys and appropriate source address restrictions are applied, the run
time reconfiguration facility should provide an adequate level of
security.

The following commands all make authenticated requests.

`addpeer` 'peer_address' [ 'keyid' ] [ 'version' ] [ `minpoll#` | `prefer` | `minpoll` 'N' | `maxpoll` 'N' [...] ]::
`addpeer` 'peer_address' [ `prefer` | `minpoll` 'N' | `maxpoll` 'N' | `keyid` 'N' | `version` 'N' [...] ]::
  Add a configured peer association at the given address and operating
  in symmetric active mode. Note that an existing association with the
  same peer may be deleted when this command is executed, or may simply
  be converted to conform to the new configuration, as appropriate. If
  the `keyid` is nonzero, all outgoing packets to the remote server will
  have an authentication field attached encrypted with this key. If the
  value is 0 (or not given) no authentication will be done. If ntpdc's
  key number has not yet been set (_e.g.,_ by the keyid command), it
  will be set to this value. The `version#` can be 1 through 4 and
  defaults to 3. The remaining options are either a numeric value for
  `minpoll` or literals `prefer`, `burst`, `minpoll` _N_, `keyid` _N_,
  `version` _N_, or `maxpoll` _N_ (where _N_ is a numeric value), and
  have the action as specified in the `peer` configuration file command
  of ntpd. See the link:confopt.html[Server Options] page for further
  information. Each flag (or its absence) replaces the previous setting.
  The `prefer` keyword indicates a preferred peer (and thus will be used
  primarily for clock synchronisation if possible). The preferred peer
  also determines the validity of the PPS signal - if the preferred peer
  is suitable for synchronisation so is the PPS signal. The `dynamic`
  keyword allows association configuration even when no suitable network
  interface is found at configuration time. The dynamic interface update
  mechanism may complete the configuration when new interfaces appear
  (e.g. WLAN/PPP interfaces) at a later time and thus render the
  association operable.

`addserver` 'peer_address' [ 'address' [ 'keyid' ] [ 'version' ] [ `minpoll` | `prefer` | `iburst` | `burst` | `minpoll` 'N' | `maxpoll` 'N' [...] ] `prefer` | `iburst` | `burst` | `minpoll` 'N' | `maxpoll` 'N' | `keyid` 'N' | `version` 'N' [...] ]::
  Identical to the addpeer command, except that the operating mode is
  client.

`broadcast` 'peer_address' [ 'keyid' ] [ 'version' ] [ 'prefer' ]::
  Identical to the addpeer command, except that the operating mode is
  broadcast. In this case a valid non-zero key identifier and key are
  required. The `peer_address` parameter can be the broadcast address of
  the local network or a multicast group address assigned to NTP. If a
  multicast address, a multicast-capable kernel is required.

`unconfig` 'peer_address' [...]::
  This command causes the configured bit to be removed from the
  specified peer(s). In many cases this will cause the peer association
  to be deleted. When appropriate, however, the association may persist
  in an unconfigured mode if the remote peer is willing to continue on
  in this fashion.

`fudge` 'peer_address' [ 'time1' ] [ 'time2' ] [ 'stratum' ] [ 'refid' ]::
  This command provides a way to set certain data for a reference clock.
  See the source listing for further information.

`enable [ auth | bclient | calibrate | kernel | monitor | ntp | pps | stats]`::
`disable [ auth | bclient | calibrate | kernel | monitor | ntp | pps | stats]`::
  These commands operate in the same way as the `enable` and `disable`
  configuration file commands of `ntpd`. See the
  link:miscopt.html[Miscellaneous Options] page for further information.

`restrict` 'address mask' 'flag' [ 'flag' ]::
  This command operates in the same way as the `restrict` configuration
  file commands of `ntpd`.

`unrestrict` 'address mask' 'flag' [ 'flag' ]::
  Unrestrict the matching entry from the restrict list.

`delrestrict` 'address' 'mask' [ 'ntpport' ]::
  Delete the matching entry from the restrict list.

`readkeys`::
  Causes the current set of authentication keys to be purged and a new
  set to be obtained by rereading the keys file (which must have been
  specified in the `ntpd` configuration file). This allows encryption
  keys to be changed without restarting the server.

`trustedkey` 'keyid' [...]::

`untrustedkey` 'keyid' [...]::
  These commands operate in the same way as the `trustedkey` and
  `untrustedkey` configuration file commands of `ntpd`.

`authinfo`::
  Returns information concerning the authentication module, including
  known keys and counts of encryptions and decryptions which have been
  done.

`traps`::
  Display the traps set in the server. See the source listing for
  further information.

`addtrap` [ 'address' [ 'port' ] [ 'interface' ]::
  Set a trap for asynchronous messages. See the source listing for
  further information.

`clrtrap` [ 'address' [ 'port' ] [ 'interface']::
  Clear a trap for asynchronous messages. See the source listing for
  further information.

`reset`::
  Clear the statistics counters in various modules of the server. See
  the source listing for further information.

== Bugs ==

`ntpdc` is a crude hack. Much of the information it shows is deadly
boring and could only be loved by its implementer. The program was
designed so that new (and temporary) features were easy to hack in, at
great expense to the program's ease of use. Despite this, the program is
occasionally useful.
