For historic news from NTP Classic, see devel/TODO in the distribution.

Much of the traditional function of a news file is now better addressed
by browsing the comments in the revision history.  This file will focus
on user-visible changes.

== Repository head ==

The rarely-used saveconfig feature in ntpq, and various associated
configuration directives, have been removed for security reasons. The
ntpd --saveconfigquit option, undocumented in NTP Classic, has
also been removed.

Refclock 27 (ARCRON MSF) has been removed on the advice of last maintainer.

Refclock 45 (Spectracom TSYNC PCI); has been removed. It required a
proprietary driver.  As a matter of good security policy, NTPsec will
not trust nor attempt to support code it cannot audit.

Refclock 35 (Conrad Parallel Port radio) has been removed.  It required
a third-party parallel-port driver for Linux that no longer exists.

This release contains a fix for one vulnerability inherited from
NTP Classic:

[Bug 3044] (CVE-2016-4954) Processing spoofed server packets

https://lists.ntpsec.org/pipermail/devel/2016-June/001299.html provides
additional information on this issue.

It also includes the following fix cross-ported from Classic:

[Bug 3047] refclock_jjy does not work with C-DEX JST2000

== 2016-05-17: 0.9.3 ==

The long-deprecated Autokey feature has been removed.

This release contains fixes for three vulnerabilities inherited from
NTP Classic:

[Bug 2978] (CVE-2016-1548) Interleave-pivot (Credit: Miroslav Lichvar of
  RedHat and Jonathan Gardner of Cisco ASIG)

The following non-security fixes have been
forward-ported from Classic:

[Bug 2772] adj_systime overflows tv_usec
[Bug 2814] msyslog deadlock when signaled.
[Bug 2829] Look at pipe_fds in ntpd.c
[Bug 2887] fudge stratum only accepts values [0..16].
[Bug 2958] ntpq: fatal error messages need a final newline.
[Bug 2965] Local clock didn't work since 4.2.8p4.
[Bug 2969] Segfault from ntpq/mrulist when looking at server with lots of clients

We regard NTP Classic's [Bug 3012] (CVE-2016-1549) Sybil
vulnerability: ephemeral association attack (Credit: Matthew van Gundy
of Cisco ASIG) as a duplicate of CVE-2015-7974 (see 0.9.1 release
notes) and it is WONTFIX for the time being: it is
correct-but-unfortunate behavior consequent to confusing and
inflexible semantics of ntp.conf's acesss control language, and we
will address it with a future redesign effort. NTP Classic has
partially addressed this pair of issues by extending the syntax of
ntp.keys to support IP ACLing. We are not currently aware of any
demand for this feature among NTPsec users and have no plans to
implement it; if you have a need for it, please file a bug at
https://gitlab.com/groups/NTPsec/issues to let us know you're out
there.

The remainder of the security issues patched in NTP Classic 4.2.8p7
either are not believed to impact NTPsec or were already fixed in a
previous release.

== 2016-03-15: 0.9.2 ==

Point release.

* can now cross-compile
* many documentation fixes
* Coverity is even more strict
* remove WWV, transmitter protocol changed, nobody builds receivers
* remove updwtmpx stuff, no longer useful

== 2016-01-25: 0.9.1 ==

Point release for security. Fixes:

* CVE-2015-7973: Replay attack on authenticated broadcast mode
  (Aanchal Malhotra)
* CVE-2015-7975: nextvar() missing length check (Jonathan Gardner)
* CVE-2015-7979: Off-path Denial of Service (DoS) attack on
  authenticated broadcast and other preemptable modes (Aanchal
  Malhotra)
* CVE-2015-8138: Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass (Matthew van Gundy &
  Jonathan Gardner)
* CVE-2015-8139: Origin Leak: ntpq and ntpdc Disclose Origin Timestamp
  to Unauthenticated Clients (Matthew van Gundy)
* CVE-2015-8158: Potential Infinite Loop in ntpq (Jonathan Gardner)
* CVE-2016-1550: Timing attack on MAC verification (Daniel Franke)
* Missing length checks in decodearr() and outputarr() (Daniel Franke)

Two additional security issues have been reported to us for which we
are not implementing code changes, but the user should be aware of
their impact.

The first (CVE-2015-8140) pertains to NTP's dynamic reconfiguration
feature, which permits on-the-fly modification of NTP's configuration
via ntpq. This feature is rarely used, typically disabled, and can
only be enabled when authentication is configured. ntpd has no means
of detecting that a request to change its configuration is a replay of
an old packet. Therefore, if an administrator sets ntpd to
configuration A and then to configuration B, an attacker who captures
the packets commanding these changes can replay the first one and
restore ntpd's state to configuration A. This is only a concern when
the configuration commands are sent over an untrusted
network. Configuration changes made via localhost are not susceptible.

This is an inherent design flaw in NTP cryptography and in the remote
reconfiguration protocol, and can be fixed only with a considerable
reworking and by changing the protocol in a way that is neither
forward nor backward compatible. This cryptographic rework is on the
horizon in the form of Network Time Security (currently a draft in the
IETF network time working group). Given that this vulnerability
impacts few if any real users, we have chosen to defer fixing it until
we have tools more suitable to the task. For the mean time, if you
rely on NTP's reconfiguration support, we recommend either restricting
its use to localhost or trusted networks, or tunneling through SSH or
a VPN. The 'nomodify' option to the 'restrict' directive may be used
to enforce this policy.

The second (CVE-2015-7974) pertains to the fact that when multiple
trusted keys are configured, no mechanism exists to associate
particular keys with particular peers or assign particular privileges.
This is not a bug, per se, but rather a lack of expressiveness in
NTP's configuration language. We intend to address in a future release
as part of a larger redesign aimed at giving clearer semantics to the
configuration language and making it easier to write safe
configurations.

Note that NTPsec is not impacted by CVE-2015-7976, CVE-2015-7977, or
CVE-2015-7978. CVE-2015-7977 and CVE-2015-7978 both pertain to mode 7
packets, support for which was completely removed before NTPsec's
first beta. CVE-2015-7976 is a feature request to restrict the format
of filenames used in saveconfig commands. Saveconfig support is
disabled at compile time in NTPsec and will not be re-enabled without
much more extensive hardening.

Other fixes:

Coverity found a slow memory leak in the asynchronous-DNS code.

== 2015-11-16: 0.9.0 ==

Initial NTPsec beta release.

* Canonical forge for git clones and issue tracking is
  https://gitlab.com/NTPsec/ntpsec

* The documentation has been extensively updated and revised.  One
  important change is that manual pages are now generated from the
  same masters as this web documentation, so the two will no longer
  drift out of synchronization.

* Internally, there is more consistent use of nanosecond precision.
  A visible effect of this is that time stepping with sufficiently
  high-precision time sources could be accurate down to nanoseconds
  rather than microseconds; this might actually matter for GPSDOs
  and high-quality radio clocks.

* The deprecated 'ntpdc' utility, long since replaced by 'ntpq', has
  been removed.

* The 'ntpsnmpd' daemon, incomplete and not conformant with RFC 5907,
  has been removed.

* A number of obsolete refclocks have been removed.

* The 'sntp' program has been renamed 'ntpdig' in order to make
  NTP installables have a uniform name prefix and take up less
  namespace. Also, ntp-keygen is now 'ntpkeygen', ntp-wait
  is 'ntpwait', and update-leap is now 'ntpleapfetch'.

* A new utility, 'ntpfrob', collects several small diagnostic functions
  for reading and tweaking the local clock hardware, including reading
  the clock tick rate, precision, and jitter. Part of it formerly
  traveled as 'tickadj'.

* The deprecated 'ntpdate' program has been replaced with a shell
  wrapper around 'ntpdig'.

* Log timestamps look a little different; they are now in ISO8601 format.

* Autokey is not supported in this release.

== Bugfixes either ported from NTP Classic or fixed by NTPsec changes ==

Additionally the NTPsec team is aware of the following vulnerabilities
impacting autokey: CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702. NTPsec
does not support building with autokey support and therefore is not
exposed; the vulnerable code will not be fixed, but will be removed in
a future release.

NTPsec is not impacted by CVE-2015-7848 (mode 7 loop counter underrun)
because ntpdc and support for mode 7 packets have been removed.
