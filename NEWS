For historic news from NTP Classic, see devel/TODO in the distribution.

Much of the traditional function of a news file is now better addressed
by browsing the comments in the revision history.  This file will focus
on user-visible changes.

== Bugfixes either ported from NTP Classic or fixed by NTPsec changes ==

These reflect fixes to NTP Classic since the 2015-06-06 fork point.

Additionally the NTPsec team is aware of the following vulnerabilities
impacting autokey: CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702. NTPsec
does not support building with autokey support and therefore is not
exposed; the vulnerable code will not be fixed, but will be removed in
a future release.

NTPsec is not impacted by CVE-2015-7848 (mode 7 loop counter underrun)
because ntpdc and support for mode 7 packets have been removed.

== 2015-09-16 release version 0.9.0, now open to public development ==
