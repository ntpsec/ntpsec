For historic news from NTP Classic, see devel/TODO in the distribution.

Much of the traditional function of a news file is now better addressed
by browsing the comments in the revision history.  This file will focus
on user-visible changes.

== 2015-11-16: 0.9.0 ==

Initial NTPsec beta release.

* The documentation has been extensively updated and revised.  One
  important change is that manual pages are now generated from the
  same masters as this web documentation, so the two will no longer
  drift out of synchronization.  

* Internally, there is more consistent use of nanosecond precision.
  A visible effect of this is that time stepping with sufficiently
  high-precision time sources could be accurate down to nanoseconds
  rather than microseconds; this might actually matter for GPSDOs
  and high-quality radio clocks.

* The deprecated ntpdc utility, long since replaced by ntpq, has been removed.

* The ntpsnmpd daemon, incomplete and not conformant with RFC 5907,
  has been removed.

* A number of obsolete refclocks have been removed.

* The sntp program has been renamed 'ntpdig' in order to make
  NTP installables have a uniform name prefix and take up less
  namespace. Also, ntp-keygen is now ntpkeygen, ntp-wait
  is ntpwait}, and update-leap is now ntpleapfetch.

* A new utility, ntpfrob, collects several small diagnostic functions
  for reading and tweaking the local clock hardware, including reading
  the clock tick rate, precision, and jitter. Part of it formerly
  traveled as tickadj.

* The deprecated ntpdate program has been replaced with a shell
  wrapper around ntpdig.

* Log timestamps look a little different; they are now in ISO8601 format.

* Autokey is not supported in this release.

== Bugfixes either ported from NTP Classic or fixed by NTPsec changes ==

These reflect fixes to NTP Classic between the 2015-06-06 fork point and
the 0.9.0 beta release.

* [Bug 2625] Deprecate flag1 in local refclock.  Hal Murray, Harlan Stenn.
* [Bug 2778] Implement "apeers"  ntpq command to include associd.
* [Bug 2823] ntpsweep with recursive peers option doesn't work.  H.Stenn.
* [Bug 2836] DFC77 patches from Frank Kardel to make decoding more
  robust, and require 2 consecutive timestamps to be consistent.
* [Bug 2845] Harden memory allocation in ntpd; implement and
  use 'eallocarray(...)' where appropriate.
* [Bug 2846] Report 'unsynchronized' status during the leap second.
* [Bug 2849] Systems with more than one default route may never
  synchronize.  Brian Utterback.  Note that this patch might need to
  be reverted once Bug 2043 has been fixed.
* [Bug 2855] Implement conditional leap smear feature; includes
  later fixes for parser support and reporting leap smear in the REFID.
* [Bug 2859] Improve raw DCF77 robustness decoding.  Frank Kardel.
* [Bug 2860] ntpq ifstats sanity check is too stringent.  Frank Kardel.
* [Bug 2866] segmentation fault at initgroups().  Harlan Stenn.
* [Bug 2867] ntpd with autokey active crashed by 'ntpq -crv'
* [Bug 2883] ntpd crashes on exit with empty driftfile.  Miroslav Lichvar.
* [Bug 2886] Misspelling: "outlyer" should be "outlier"
* [Bug 2890] Ignore ENOBUFS on routing netlink socket.  Konstantin Khlebnikov.
* [Bug 2902] configuration directives "pidfile" and "driftfile"
  should be local-only. (patch by Miroslav Lichvar) (CVE-2015-7703)
* [Bug 2909] Slow memory leak in CRYPTO_ASSOC (CVE-2015-7701)
* [Bug 2941] NAK to the Future: Symmetric association authentication
  bypass via crypto-NAK (CVE-2015-7871)
* [Bug 2922] decodenetnum() will ASSERT botch instead of returning
  FAIL on some bogus values (CVE-2015-7855)
* [Bug 2921] Password Length Memory Corruption Vulnerability (CVE-2015-7854)
* [Bug 2920] Invalid length data provided by a custom refclock driver
  could cause a buffer overflow (CVE-2015-7853)
* [Bug 2919] ntpq atoascii() potential memory corruption (CVE-2015-7852)
* [Bug 2918] saveconfig Directory Traversal Vulnerability. (OpenVMS)
  (CVE-2015-7851)
* [Bug 2916] trusted key use-after-free (CVE-2015-7849)
* [Bug 2901] Clients that receive a KoD should validate the origin
  timestamp field (CVE-2015-7704, CVE-2015-7705)

Additionally the NTPsec team is aware of the following vulnerabilities
impacting autokey: CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702. NTPsec
does not support building with autokey support and therefore is not
exposed; the vulnerable code will not be fixed, but will be removed in
a future release.

NTPsec is not impacted by CVE-2015-7848 (mode 7 loop counter underrun)
because ntpdc and support for mode 7 packets have been removed.
