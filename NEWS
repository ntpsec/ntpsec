For historic news from NTP Classic, see devel/HISTORIC-NEWS in the
distribution.

Much of the traditional function of a news file is now better addressed
by browsing the comments in the revision history.  This file will focus
on user-visible changes.

== Repository head ==

ntpkeygen has been moved from C to Python.  This is not a functional
change, just another move to improve maintainability and reduce attack
surface by decreasing line count.

ntpdig has also been moved from C to Python. Though this is also
mostly a move to reduce line count, the new version does have some
functional changes.  Obsolete options have been dropped, logging is
done a bit differently, and the synchronization-distance computation has
been brought up to date with ntpd's. Also, this version can be told to
collect multiple samples and use whichever has the lowest combination
of stratum and synch distance.

A new tool for time-service operators, ntpmon, supports real-time
monitoring of your NTP installation's status.

== 2016-11-23: 0.9.5 ==

This release includes a substantial refactoring of the core protocol
implementation. Due to unresolvable security issues, support for
broadcast/multicast clients has been dropped; broadcast servers are
still supported. Likewise, symmetric mode is now only partially
supported. The `peer` directive has become a synonym for `server`.
Servers which receive symmetric-active mode packets will immediately
give a symmetric-passive-mode response, but will not mobilize a new
association.

All remaining Perl code in the distribution has been moved to Python.

The trap feature, broken in NTP Classic at the time of the NTPSec fork,
has been removed. So has its only known client, the ntptrap script in the
distribution.

A new visualization tool, ntpviz, generates graphical summaries of
logfile data that can be helpful for identifying problems such as
misconfigured servers.  It replaces a messy and poorly documented pile
of ancient Perl, awk, and S scripts; those have been removed.

It is now possible (and sometimes useful) to say "minpoll 0" for a
1-second interval.

The ntpq tool for querying and configuring a running ntpd has been
moved from C to Python.  About the only visible effect this has is
that ntpq now resizes its peers display to accommodate wide
terminal-emulator windows.

This release includes fixes for four low and medium-severity
vulnerabilities:

CVE-2016-7434: Null pointer dereference on malformed mrulist request
CVE-2016-7429: Interface selection DoS
CVE-2016-9311: Trap crash
CVE-2016-9310: Mode 6 unauthenticated trap information disclosure and DDoS vector

Note that the "fixes" for CVE-2016-9310/9311 consist of complete
removal of the broken trap feature. This removal occurred post-0.9.4
but prior to the discovery of these issues.

Further, an additional low-severity issue impacting 0.9.0 through
0.9.3 has come to our attention:

CVE-2016-7433: Reboot sync calculation problem

This issue was already addressed in 0.9.4 but not treated as a
vulnerability.

The following NTP Classic CVEs do not impact NTPsec: CVE-2016-7427,
CVE-2016-7428, CVE-2016-9312, CVE-2016-7431. We reject CVE-2016-7426,
as it describes known and intended behavior which is a necessary
logical consequence of rate-limiting.

== 2016-08-16: 0.9.4 ==

usestats has been added to the statistics collection to record
system resource usage statistics.

A new, simpler configuration syntax for refclocks has been
implemented.  Configuration examples in the new syntax have been added
to each driver page.

Refclocks are now designated by name, not number. A list is available
from "./waf configure --list".

The rarely-used saveconfig feature in ntpd, and various associated
configuration directives, have been removed for security reasons. The
ntpd --saveconfigquit option, undocumented in NTP Classic, has
also been removed.

The ARCRON MSF refclock has been removed on the advice of last maintainer.

The Spectracom TSYNC PCI refclock has been removed. It required a
proprietary driver.  As a matter of good security policy, NTPsec will
not trust nor attempt to support code it cannot audit.

The Conrad Parallel Port radio refclock has been removed.  It required
a third-party parallel-port driver for Linux that no longer exists.

Both Hopf refclocks have been removed.  The 6039 driver required a
kernel driver that no longer exists; the 6021 driver duplicated
support in the generic driver.

The Austron refclock has been removed, on the grounds that it was
EOLed more than 20 years ago and there's been no aftermarket activity
or web chatter around it for a decade.

The audio-path drivers (IRIG and CHU) have been removed. The class
of hardware required to support them has gone essentially extinct due
to cheap DSP. The complexity/maintenance overhead of this code
was high enough to motivate dropping them.

This release contains a fix for one vulnerability inherited from
NTP Classic:

[Bug 3044] (CVE-2016-4954) Processing spoofed server packets

https://lists.ntpsec.org/pipermail/devel/2016-June/001299.html provides
additional information on this issue.

It also includes the following fix cross-ported from Classic:

[Bug 3047] refclock_jjy does not work with C-DEX JST2000

== 2016-05-17: 0.9.3 ==

The long-deprecated Autokey feature has been removed.

This release contains fixes for three vulnerabilities inherited from
NTP Classic:

[Bug 3020] (CVE-2016-1551) Refclock impersonation vulnerability
  (Credit: Matt Street et. al. of Cisco ASIG)
[Bug 3008] (CVE-2016-2519) ctl_getitem() return value not always checked

[Bug 2978] (CVE-2016-1548) Interleave-pivot
  (Credit: Miroslav Lichvar of RedHat and Jonathan Gardner of Cisco ASIG)

The following non-security fixes have been
forward-ported from Classic:

[Bug 2772] adj_systime overflows tv_usec
[Bug 2814] msyslog deadlock when signaled.
[Bug 2829] Look at pipe_fds in ntpd.c
[Bug 2887] fudge stratum only accepts values [0..16].
[Bug 2958] ntpq: fatal error messages need a final newline.
[Bug 2965] Local clock didn't work since 4.2.8p4.
[Bug 2969] Segfault from ntpq/mrulist when looking at server with lots of clients

We regard NTP Classic's [Bug 3012] (CVE-2016-1549) Sybil
vulnerability: ephemeral association attack (Credit: Matthew van Gundy
of Cisco ASIG) as a duplicate of CVE-2015-7974 (see 0.9.1 release
notes) and it is WONTFIX for the time being: it is
correct-but-unfortunate behavior consequent to confusing and
inflexible semantics of ntp.conf's access control language, and we
will address it with a future redesign effort. NTP Classic has
partially addressed this pair of issues by extending the syntax of
ntp.keys to support IP ACLing. We are not currently aware of any
demand for this feature among NTPsec users and have no plans to
implement it; if you have a need for it, please file a bug at
https://gitlab.com/groups/NTPsec/issues to let us know you're out
there.

The remainder of the security issues patched in NTP Classic 4.2.8p7
either are not believed to impact NTPsec or were already fixed in a
previous release.

== 2016-03-15: 0.9.2 ==

Point release.

* can now cross-compile
* many documentation fixes
* Coverity is even more strict
* remove WWV, transmitter protocol changed, nobody builds receivers
* remove updwtmpx stuff, no longer useful

== 2016-01-25: 0.9.1 ==

Point release for security. Fixes:

* CVE-2015-7973: Replay attack on authenticated broadcast mode
  (Aanchal Malhotra)
* CVE-2015-7975: nextvar() missing length check (Jonathan Gardner)
* CVE-2015-7979: Off-path Denial of Service (DoS) attack on
  authenticated broadcast and other preemptable modes (Aanchal
  Malhotra)
* CVE-2015-8138: Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass (Matthew van Gundy &
  Jonathan Gardner)
* CVE-2015-8139: Origin Leak: ntpq and ntpdc Disclose Origin Timestamp
  to Unauthenticated Clients (Matthew van Gundy)
* CVE-2015-8158: Potential Infinite Loop in ntpq (Jonathan Gardner)
* CVE-2016-1550: Timing attack on MAC verification (Daniel Franke)
* Missing length checks in decodearr() and outputarr() (Daniel Franke)

Two additional security issues have been reported to us for which we
are not implementing code changes, but the user should be aware of
their impact.

The first (CVE-2015-8140) pertains to NTP's dynamic reconfiguration
feature, which permits on-the-fly modification of NTP's configuration
via ntpq. This feature is rarely used, typically disabled, and can
only be enabled when authentication is configured. ntpd has no means
of detecting that a request to change its configuration is a replay of
an old packet. Therefore, if an administrator sets ntpd to
configuration A and then to configuration B, an attacker who captures
the packets commanding these changes can replay the first one and
restore ntpd's state to configuration A. This is only a concern when
the configuration commands are sent over an untrusted
network. Configuration changes made via localhost are not susceptible.

This is an inherent design flaw in NTP cryptography and in the remote
reconfiguration protocol, and can be fixed only with a considerable
reworking and by changing the protocol in a way that is neither
forward nor backward compatible. This cryptographic rework is on the
horizon in the form of Network Time Security (currently a draft in the
IETF network time working group). Given that this vulnerability
impacts few if any real users, we have chosen to defer fixing it until
we have tools more suitable to the task. For the mean time, if you
rely on NTP's reconfiguration support, we recommend either restricting
its use to localhost or trusted networks, or tunneling through SSH or
a VPN. The 'nomodify' option to the 'restrict' directive may be used
to enforce this policy.

The second (CVE-2015-7974) pertains to the fact that when multiple
trusted keys are configured, no mechanism exists to associate
particular keys with particular peers or assign particular privileges.
This is not a bug, per se, but rather a lack of expressiveness in
NTP's configuration language. We intend to address in a future release
as part of a larger redesign aimed at giving clearer semantics to the
configuration language and making it easier to write safe
configurations.

Note that NTPsec is not impacted by CVE-2015-7976, CVE-2015-7977, or
CVE-2015-7978. CVE-2015-7977 and CVE-2015-7978 both pertain to mode 7
packets, support for which was completely removed before NTPsec's
first beta. CVE-2015-7976 is a feature request to restrict the format
of filenames used in saveconfig commands. Saveconfig support is
disabled at compile time in NTPsec and will not be re-enabled without
much more extensive hardening.

Other fixes:

Coverity found a slow memory leak in the asynchronous-DNS code.

== 2015-11-16: 0.9.0 ==

Initial NTPsec beta release.

* Canonical forge for git clones and issue tracking is
  https://gitlab.com/NTPsec/ntpsec

* The documentation has been extensively updated and revised.  One
  important change is that manual pages are now generated from the
  same masters as this web documentation, so the two will no longer
  drift out of synchronization.

* Internally, there is more consistent use of nanosecond precision.
  A visible effect of this is that time stepping with sufficiently
  high-precision time sources could be accurate down to nanoseconds
  rather than microseconds; this might actually matter for GPSDOs
  and high-quality radio clocks.

* The deprecated 'ntpdc' utility, long since replaced by 'ntpq', has
  been removed.

* The 'ntpsnmpd' daemon, incomplete and not conformant with RFC 5907,
  has been removed.

* A number of obsolete refclocks have been removed.

* The 'sntp' program has been renamed 'ntpdig' in order to make
  NTP installables have a uniform name prefix and take up less
  namespace. Also, ntp-keygen is now 'ntpkeygen', ntp-wait
  is 'ntpwait', and update-leap is now 'ntpleapfetch'.

* A new utility, 'ntpfrob', collects several small diagnostic functions
  for reading and tweaking the local clock hardware, including reading
  the clock tick rate, precision, and jitter. Part of it formerly
  traveled as 'tickadj'.

* The deprecated 'ntpdate' program has been replaced with a shell
  wrapper around 'ntpdig'.

* Log timestamps look a little different; they are now in ISO 8601 format.

* Autokey is not supported in this release.

Additionally the NTPsec team is aware of the following vulnerabilities
impacting autokey: CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702. NTPsec
does not support building with autokey support and therefore is not
exposed; the vulnerable code will not be fixed, but will be removed in
a future release.

NTPsec is not impacted by CVE-2015-7848 (mode 7 loop counter underrun)
because ntpdc and support for mode 7 packets have been removed.
