.SH NAME
ntp.keys \- NTP symmetric key file format configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/ntp.keys
.PP 
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
This document describes the format of an NTP symmetric key file.
For a description of the use of this type of file, see the
.Qq Authentication Support
section of the
.Xr ntp.conf 5
page.
.PP
.Xr ntpd 8
reads its keys from a file specified using the
 k
command line option or the
.Ic keys
statement in the configuration file.
While key number 0 is fixed by the NTP standard
(as 56 zero bits)
and may not be changed,
one or more keys numbered between 1 and 65534
may be arbitrarily set in the keys file.
.PP
The key file uses the same comment conventions
as the configuration file.
Key entries use a fixed format of the form
.PP
.D1 Ar keyno type key
.PP
where
IkeynoR
is a positive integer (between 1 and 65534),
ItypeR
is the message digest algorithm,
and
IkeyR
is the key itself.
.PP
The
IkeyR
may be given in a format
controlled by the
ItypeR
field.
The
ItypeR
.Li MD5
is always supported.
If
.Li ntpd
was built with the OpenSSL library
then any digest library supported by that library may be specified.
However, if compliance with FIPS 140-2 is required the
ItypeR
must be either
.Li SHA
or
.Li SHA1 .
.PP
What follows are some key types, and corresponding formats:
.PP
.TP
.BR Li MD5
The key is 1 to 16 printable characters terminated by
an EOL,
whitespace,
or
a
.Li #
(which is the "start of comment" character).
.PP
.TP
.BR Li SHA
.TP
.BR Li SHA1
.TP
.BR Li RMD160
The key is a hex-encoded ASCII string of 40 characters,
which is truncated as necessary.
.PP
Note that the keys used by the
.Xr ntpq 8
and
.Xr ntpdc 8
programs are checked against passwords
requested by the programs and entered by hand,
so it is generally appropriate to specify these keys in ASCII format.
