/*
 * This driver furnishes an interface for pulse-per-second (PPS) signals
 * produced by a cesium clock, timing receiver or related equipment. It
 * can be used to remove accumulated jitter over a congested link and
 * retime a server before redistributing the time to clients. It can 
 *also be used as a holdover should all other synchronization sources
 * beconme unreachable.
 *
 * Before this driver becomes active, the local clock must be set to
 * within +-0.4 s by another means, such as a radio clock or NTP
 * itself. There are two ways to connect the PPS signal, normally at TTL
 * levels, to the computer. One is to shift to EIA levels and connect to
 * pin 8 (DCD) of a serial port. This requires a level converter and
 * may require a one-shot flipflop to lengthen the pulse. The other is
 * to connect the PPS signal directly to pin 10 (ACK) of a PC paralell
 * port. These methods are architecture dependent.
 *
 * This driver requires the Pulse-per-Second API for Unix-like Operating
 * Systems, Version 1.0, RFC-2783 (PPSAPI). Implementations are
 * available for FreeBSD, Linux, SunOS, Solaris and Tru64. However, at
 * present only the Tru64 implementation provides the full generality of
 * the API with multiple PPS drivers and multiple handles per driver. If
 * the PPSAPI is normally implemented in the /usr/include/sys/timepps.h
 * header file and kernel support specific to each operating system.
 *
 * This driver normally uses the PLL/FLL clock discipline implemented in
 * the ntpd code. Ordinarily, this is the most accurate means, as the
 * median filter in the driver interface is much larger than in the
 * kernel. However, if the systemic clock frequency error is large (tens
 * to hundreds of PPM), it's better to used the kernel support, if
 * available.
 *
 * This deriver is subject to the mitigation rules described in the
 * "mitigation rulse and the prefer peer" page. However, there is an
 * important difference. If this driver becomes the PPS driver according
 * to these rules, it is active only if (a) a prefer peer other than
 * this driver is among the survivors or (b) there are no survivors and
 * the minsane option of the tos command is zero. This is intended to
 * support space missions where updates from other spacecraft are
 * infrequent, but a reliable PPS signal, such as from an Ultra Stable
 * Oscillator (USO) is available.
 *
 * Driver options
 *
 * The PPS timestamp is captured on the rising (assert) edge if flag2 is
 * dim (default) and on the falling (clear) edge if lit. If flag3 is dim
 * (default), the kernel PPS support is disabled; if lit it is enabled.
 * If flag4 is lit, each timesampt is copied to the clockstats file for
 * later analysis. This can be useful when constructing Allan deviation
 * plots. The time1 parameter can be used to compensate for
 * miscellaneous device driver and OS delays.
