.SH NAME
ntp.keys \- NTP symmetric key file format configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/ntp.keys
.PP 
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
This document describes the format of an NTP symmetric key file.
For a description of the use of this type of file, see the
.Qq Authentication Support
section of the
.Xr ntp.conf 5
page.
.PP
.Xr ntpd 8
reads its keys from a file specified using the
k
command line option or the
.Ic keys
statement in the configuration file.
While key number 0 is fixed by the NTP standard
(as 56 zero bits)
and may not be changed,
one or more keys numbered between 1 and 65534
may be arbitrarily set in the keys file.
.PP
The key file uses the same comment conventions
as the configuration file.
Key entries use a fixed format of the form
.PP
.D1 Ar keyno type key
.PP
where
\fIkeyno\fR
is a positive integer (between 1 and 65534),
\fItype\fR
is the message digest algorithm,
and
\fIkey\fR
is the key itself.
.PP
The
\fIkey\fR
may be given in a format
controlled by the
\fItype\fR
field.
The
\fItype\fR
.Li MD5
is always supported.
If
.Li ntpd
was built with the OpenSSL library
then any digest library supported by that library may be specified.
However, if compliance with FIPS 140-2 is required the
\fItype\fR
must be either
.Li SHA
or
.Li SHA1 .
.PP
What follows are some key types, and corresponding formats:
.PP
.TP
.BR Li MD5
The key is 1 to 16 printable characters terminated by
an EOL,
whitespace,
or
a
.Li #
(which is the "start of comment" character).
.PP
.TP
.BR Li SHA
.TP
.BR Li SHA1
.TP
.BR Li RMD160
The key is a hex-encoded ASCII string of 40 characters,
which is truncated as necessary.
.PP
Note that the keys used by the
.Xr ntpq 8
and
.Xr ntpdc 8
programs are checked against passwords
requested by the programs and entered by hand,
so it is generally appropriate to specify these keys in ASCII format.
