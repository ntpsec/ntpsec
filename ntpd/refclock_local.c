/*
 * This is a hack to allow a machine to use its own system clock as a
 * reference clock, i.e., to free-run using no outside clock discipline
 * source. Note that the clock selection algorithm will not select this
 * driver unless all other sources of synchronization have been lost.
 * This is useful if you want to use NTP in an isolated environment
 * with no radio clock or NIST modem available. Pick a machine that you
 * figure has a good clock oscillator and configure it with this
 * driver. Set the clock using the best means available, like
 * eyeball-and-wristwatch. Then, point all the other machines at this
 * one or use broadcast (not multicast) mode to distribute time.
 *
 * Another application for this driver is if you want to use a
 * particular server's clock as the clock of last resort when all other
 * normal synchronization sources have gone away. This is especially
 * useful if that server has an ovenized oscillator. However, the
 * preferred was to do this is using orphan mode. See the documentation.
 *
 * A third application for this driver is when an external discipline
 * source is available, such as the NIST "lockclock" program, which
 * synchronizes the local clock via a telephone modem and the NIST
 * Automated Computer Time Service (ACTS), or the Digital Time
 * Synchronization Service (DTSS), which runs on DCE machines. In this
 * case the stratum should be set at zero, indicating a bona fide
 * stratum-1 source. Exercise some caution with this, since there is no
 * easy way to telegraph via NTP that something might be wrong in the
 * discipline source itself. In the case of DTSS, the local clock can
 * have a rather large jitter, depending on the interval between
 * corrections and the intrinsic frequency error of the clock
 * oscillator. In extreme cases, this can cause clients to exceed the
 * 128-ms slew window and drop off the NTP subnet.
 *
 * Fudge Factors
 *
 * None currently supported.
