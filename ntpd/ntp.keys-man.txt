== NAME ==
ntp.keys - NTP symmetric key file format configuration file

== DESCRIPTION ==

This document describes the format of an NTP symmetric key file. For a
description of the use of this type of file, see the "Authentication
Support" page of the Web documentation.

{ntpdman} reads its keys from a file specified using the -k command line
option or the 'keys' statement in the configuration file. While key
number 0 is fixed by the NTP standard (as 56 zero bits) and may not be
changed, one or more keys numbered between 1 and 65534 may be
arbitrarily set in the keys file.

The key file uses the same comment conventions as the configuration
file. Key entries use a fixed format of the form

--------------
keyno type key
--------------

where `keyno` is a positive integer (between 1 and 65534),
`type` is the message digest algorithm, and
`key` is the key itself.

The `key` may be given in a format controlled by the `type` field. The
`type` MD5 is always supported.  If ntpd was built with the OpenSSL
library then any digest library supported by that library may be
specified. However, if compliance with FIPS 140-2 is required the
`type` must be 'SHA1'.

What follows are some key types, and corresponding formats:

_MD5_::
  The key is 1 to 16 printable characters terminated by an EOL,
  whitespace, or a _#_ (which is the "start of comment" character).
_SHA1_; _RMD160_::
  The key is a hex-encoded ASCII string of 40 characters, which is
  truncated as necessary.
+
Note that the keys used by the {ntpqman} programs are
checked against passwords requested by the programs and entered by
hand, so it is generally appropriate to specify these keys in ASCII
format.

== FILES ==

`/etc/ntp.keys`::
  the default name of the configuration file
