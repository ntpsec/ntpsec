  <p>The
<code>ntp.conf</code>
configuration file is read at initial startup by the
<code>ntpd(1ntpdmdoc)</code>
daemon in order to specify the synchronization sources,
modes and other related information. 
Usually, it is installed in the
<span class="file">/etc</span>
directory,
but could be installed elsewhere
(see the daemon's
<code>-c</code>
command line option).

  <p>The file format is similar to other
<span class="sc">UNIX</span>
configuration files. 
Comments begin with a
#
character and extend to the end of the line;
blank lines are ignored. 
Configuration commands consist of an initial keyword
followed by a list of arguments,
some of which may be optional, separated by whitespace. 
Commands may not be continued over multiple lines. 
Arguments may be host names,
host addresses written in numeric, dotted-quad form,
integers, floating point numbers (when specifying times in seconds)
and text strings.

  <p>The rest of this page describes the configuration and control options. 
The
"Notes on Configuring NTP and Setting up an NTP Subnet"
page
(available as part of the HTML documentation
provided in
<span class="file">/usr/share/doc/ntp</span>)
contains an extended discussion of these options. 
In addition to the discussion of general
<a href="#Configuration-Options">Configuration Options</a>,
there are sections describing the following supported functionality
and the options used to control it:

<h3 class="section">Configuration Support</h3>

<p>Following is a description of the configuration commands in
NTPv4. 
These commands have the same basic functions as in NTPv3 and
in some cases new functions and new arguments. 
There are two
classes of commands, configuration commands that configure a
persistent association with a remote server or peer or reference
clock, and auxiliary commands that specify environmental variables
that control various related operations. 
<div class="node">
<p><hr>
<a name="Configuration-Commands"></a>
<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">Configuration Commands</h3>

<p>The various modes are determined by the command keyword and the
type of the required IP address. 
Addresses are classed by type as
(s) a remote server or peer (IPv4 class A, B and C), (b) the
broadcast address of a local interface, (m) a multicast address (IPv4
class D), or (r) a reference clock address (127.127.x.x). 
Note that
only those options applicable to each command are listed below. 
Use
of options not listed may not be caught as an error, but may result
in some weird and even destructive behavior.

  <p>If the Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6 (RFC-2553)
is detected, support for the IPv6 address family is generated
in addition to the default support of the IPv4 address family. 
In a few cases, including the reslist billboard generated
by ntpdc, IPv6 addresses are automatically generated. 
IPv6 addresses can be identified by the presence of colons
:
in the address field. 
IPv6 addresses can be used almost everywhere where
IPv4 addresses can be used,
with the exception of reference clock addresses,
which are always IPv4.

  <p>Note that in contexts where a host name is expected, a
<code>-4</code>
qualifier preceding
the host name forces DNS resolution to the IPv4 namespace,
while a
<code>-6</code>
qualifier forces DNS resolution to the IPv6 namespace. 
See IPv6 references for the
equivalent classes for that address family.

  <p>These five commands specify the time server name or address to
be used and the mode in which to operate. 
The
<kbd>address</kbd>
can be
either a DNS name or an IP address in dotted-quad notation. 
Additional information on association behavior can be found in the
"Association Management"
page
(available as part of the HTML documentation
provided in
<span class="file">/usr/share/doc/ntp</span>).
     <dl>
<dt><code>pool</code><dd>For type s addresses, this command mobilizes a persistent
client mode association with a number of remote servers. 
In this mode the local clock can synchronized to the
remote server, but the remote server can never be synchronized to
the local clock. 
<br><dt><code>server</code><dd>For type s and r addresses, this command mobilizes a persistent
client mode association with the specified remote server or local
radio clock. 
In this mode the local clock can synchronized to the
remote server, but the remote server can never be synchronized to
the local clock. 
This command should
<em> not</em>
be used for type
b or m addresses. 
<br><dt><code>peer</code><dd>For type s addresses (only), this command mobilizes a
persistent symmetric-active mode association with the specified
remote peer. 
In this mode the local clock can be synchronized to
the remote peer or the remote peer can be synchronized to the local
clock. 
This is useful in a network of servers where, depending on
various failure scenarios, either the local or remote peer may be
the better source of time. 
This command should NOT be used for type
b, m or r addresses. 
<br><dt><code>broadcast</code><dd>For type b and m addresses (only), this
command mobilizes a persistent broadcast mode association. 
Multiple
commands can be used to specify multiple local broadcast interfaces
(subnets) and/or multiple multicast groups. 
Note that local
broadcast messages go only to the interface associated with the
subnet specified, but multicast messages go to all interfaces. 
In broadcast mode the local server sends periodic broadcast
messages to a client population at the
<kbd>address</kbd>
specified, which is usually the broadcast address on (one of) the
local network(s) or a multicast address assigned to NTP. 
The IANA
has assigned the multicast group address IPv4 224.0.1.1 and
IPv6 ff05::101 (site local) exclusively to
NTP, but other nonconflicting addresses can be used to contain the
messages within administrative boundaries. 
Ordinarily, this
specification applies only to the local server operating as a
sender; for operation as a broadcast client, see the
<code>broadcastclient</code>
or
<code>multicastclient</code>
commands
below. 
<br><dt><code>manycastclient</code><dd>For type m addresses (only), this command mobilizes a
manycast client mode association for the multicast address
specified. 
In this case a specific address must be supplied which
matches the address used on the
<code>manycastserver</code>
command for
the designated manycast servers. 
The NTP multicast address
224.0.1.1 assigned by the IANA should NOT be used, unless specific
means are taken to avoid spraying large areas of the Internet with
these messages and causing a possibly massive implosion of replies
at the sender. 
The
<code>manycastserver</code>
command specifies that the local server
is to operate in client mode with the remote servers that are
discovered as the result of broadcast/multicast messages. 
The
client broadcasts a request message to the group address associated
with the specified
<kbd>address</kbd>
and specifically enabled
servers respond to these messages. 
The client selects the servers
providing the best time and continues as with the
<code>server</code>
command. 
The remaining servers are discarded as if never
heard.

<a name="Authentication-Support"></a>
<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">Authentication Support</h3>

<p>Authentication support allows the NTP client to verify that the
server is in fact known and trusted and not an intruder intending
accidentally or on purpose to masquerade as that server. 
The NTPv3
specification RFC-1305 defines a scheme which provides
cryptographic authentication of received NTP packets. 
Originally,
this was done using the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm
operating in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, commonly called
DES-CBC. 
Subsequently, this was replaced by the RSA Message Digest
5 (MD5) algorithm using a private key, commonly called keyed-MD5. 
Either algorithm computes a message digest, or one-way hash, which
can be used to verify the server has the correct private key and
key identifier.

  <p>NTPv4 retains the NTPv3 scheme, properly described as symmetric key
cryptography and, in addition, provides a new Autokey scheme
based on public key cryptography. 
Public key cryptography is generally considered more secure
than symmetric key cryptography, since the security is based
on a private value which is generated by each server and
never revealed. 
With Autokey all key distribution and
management functions involve only public values, which
considerably simplifies key distribution and storage. 
Public key management is based on X.509 certificates,
which can be provided by commercial services or
produced by utility programs in the OpenSSL software library
or the NTPv4 distribution.

  <p>While the algorithms for symmetric key cryptography are
included in the NTPv4 distribution, public key cryptography
requires the OpenSSL software library to be installed
before building the NTP distribution. 
Directions for doing that
are on the Building and Installing the Distribution page.

  <p>Authentication is configured separately for each association
using the
<code>key</code>
or
<code>autokey</code>
subcommand on the
<code>peer</code>,
<code>server</code>,
<code>broadcast</code>
and
<code>manycastclient</code>
configuration commands as described in
<a href="#Configuration-Options">Configuration Options</a>
page. 
The authentication
options described below specify the locations of the key files,
if other than default, which symmetric keys are trusted
and the interval between various operations, if other than default.

  <p>Authentication is always enabled,
although ineffective if not configured as
described below. 
If a NTP packet arrives
including a message authentication
code (MAC), it is accepted only if it
passes all cryptographic checks. 
The
checks require correct key ID, key value
and message digest. 
If the packet has
been modified in any way or replayed
by an intruder, it will fail one or more
of these checks and be discarded. 
Furthermore, the Autokey scheme requires a
preliminary protocol exchange to obtain
the server certificate, verify its
credentials and initialize the protocol

  <p>The
<code>auth</code>
flag controls whether new associations or
remote configuration commands require cryptographic authentication. 
This flag can be set or reset by the
<code>enable</code>
and
<code>disable</code>
commands and also by remote
configuration commands sent by a
<code>ntpdc(1ntpdcmdoc)</code>
program running in
another machine. 
If this flag is enabled, which is the default
case, new broadcast client and symmetric passive associations and
remote configuration commands must be cryptographically
authenticated using either symmetric key or public key cryptography. 
If this
flag is disabled, these operations are effective
even if not cryptographic
authenticated. 
It should be understood
that operating with the
<code>auth</code>
flag disabled invites a significant vulnerability
where a rogue hacker can
masquerade as a falseticker and seriously
disrupt system timekeeping. 
It is
important to note that this flag has no purpose
other than to allow or disallow
a new association in response to new broadcast
and symmetric active messages
and remote configuration commands and, in particular,
the flag has no effect on
the authentication process itself.

  <p>An attractive alternative where multicast support is available
is manycast mode, in which clients periodically troll
for servers as described in the
<a href="#Automatic-NTP-Configuration-Options">Automatic NTP Configuration Options</a>
page. 
Either symmetric key or public key
cryptographic authentication can be used in this mode. 
The principle advantage
of manycast mode is that potential servers need not be
configured in advance,
since the client finds them during regular operation,
and the configuration
files for all clients can be identical.

  <p>The security model and protocol schemes for
both symmetric key and public key
cryptography are summarized below;
further details are in the briefings, papers
and reports at the NTP project page linked from
<code>http://www.ntp.org/</code>. 
<div class="node">
<p><hr>
<a name="Symmetric_002dKey-Cryptography"></a>
<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">Symmetric-Key Cryptography</h3>

<p>The original RFC-1305 specification allows any one of possibly
65,534 keys, each distinguished by a 32-bit key identifier, to
authenticate an association. 
The servers and clients involved must
agree on the key and key identifier to
authenticate NTP packets. 
Keys and
related information are specified in a key
file, usually called
<span class="file">ntp.keys</span>,
which must be distributed and stored using
secure means beyond the scope of the NTP protocol itself. 
Besides the keys used
for ordinary NTP associations,
additional keys can be used as passwords for the
<code>ntpq(1ntpqmdoc)</code>
and
<code>ntpdc(1ntpdcmdoc)</code>
utility programs.

  <p>When
<code>ntpd(1ntpdmdoc)</code>
is first started, it reads the key file specified in the
<code>keys</code>
configuration command and installs the keys
in the key cache. 
However,
individual keys must be activated with the
<code>trusted</code>
command before use. 
This
allows, for instance, the installation of possibly
several batches of keys and
then activating or deactivating each batch
remotely using
<code>ntpdc(1ntpdcmdoc)</code>. 
This also provides a revocation capability that can be used
if a key becomes compromised. 
The
<code>requestkey</code>
command selects the key used as the password for the
<code>ntpdc(1ntpdcmdoc)</code>
utility, while the
<code>controlkey</code>
command selects the key used as the password for the
<code>ntpq(1ntpqmdoc)</code>
utility. 
<div class="node">
<p><hr>
<a name="Public-Key-Cryptography"></a>
<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">Public Key Cryptography</h3>

<p>NTPv4 supports the original NTPv3 symmetric key scheme
described in RFC-1305 and in addition the Autokey protocol,
which is based on public key cryptography. 
The Autokey Version 2 protocol described on the Autokey Protocol
page verifies packet integrity using MD5 message digests
and verifies the source with digital signatures and any of several
digest/signature schemes. 
Optional identity schemes described on the Identity Schemes
page and based on cryptographic challenge/response algorithms
are also available. 
Using all of these schemes provides strong security against
replay with or without modification, spoofing, masquerade
and most forms of clogging attacks.

  <p>The Autokey protocol has several modes of operation
corresponding to the various NTP modes supported. 
Most modes use a special cookie which can be
computed independently by the client and server,
but encrypted in transmission. 
All modes use in addition a variant of the S-KEY scheme,
in which a pseudo-random key list is generated and used
in reverse order. 
These schemes are described along with an executive summary,
current status, briefing slides and reading list on the
<a href="#Autonomous-Authentication">Autonomous Authentication</a>
page.

  <p>The specific cryptographic environment used by Autokey servers
and clients is determined by a set of files
and soft links generated by the
<code>ntp-keygen(1ntpkeygenmdoc)</code>
program. 
This includes a required host key file,
required certificate file and optional sign key file,
leapsecond file and identity scheme files. 
The
digest/signature scheme is specified in the X.509 certificate
along with the matching sign key. 
There are several schemes
available in the OpenSSL software library, each identified
by a specific string such as
<code>md5WithRSAEncryption</code>,
which stands for the MD5 message digest with RSA
encryption scheme. 
The current NTP distribution supports
all the schemes in the OpenSSL library, including
those based on RSA and DSA digital signatures.

  <p>NTP secure groups can be used to define cryptographic compartments
and security hierarchies. 
It is important that every host
in the group be able to construct a certificate trail to one
or more trusted hosts in the same group. 
Each group
host runs the Autokey protocol to obtain the certificates
for all hosts along the trail to one or more trusted hosts. 
This requires the configuration file in all hosts to be
engineered so that, even under anticipated failure conditions,
the NTP subnet will form such that every group host can find
a trail to at least one trusted host. 
<div class="node">
<p><hr>
<a name="Naming-and-Addressing"></a>
<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">Naming and Addressing</h3>

<p>It is important to note that Autokey does not use DNS to
resolve addresses, since DNS can't be completely trusted
until the name servers have synchronized clocks. 
The cryptographic name used by Autokey to bind the host identity
credentials and cryptographic values must be independent
of interface, network and any other naming convention. 
The name appears in the host certificate in either or both
the subject and issuer fields, so protection against
DNS compromise is essential.

  <p>By convention, the name of an Autokey host is the name returned
by the Unix
<code>gethostname(2)</code>
system call or equivalent in other systems. 
By the system design
model, there are no provisions to allow alternate names or aliases. 
However, this is not to say that DNS aliases, different names
for each interface, etc., are constrained in any way.

  <p>It is also important to note that Autokey verifies authenticity
using the host name, network address and public keys,
all of which are bound together by the protocol specifically
to deflect masquerade attacks. 
For this reason Autokey
includes the source and destinatino IP addresses in message digest
computations and so the same addresses must be available
at both the server and client. 
For this reason operation
with network address translation schemes is not possible. 
This reflects the intended robust security model where government
and corporate NTP servers are operated outside firewall perimeters. 
<div class="node">
<p><hr>
<a name="Operation"></a>
<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">Operation</h3>

<p>A specific combination of authentication scheme (none,
symmetric key, public key) and identity scheme is called
a cryptotype, although not all combinations are compatible. 
There may be management configurations where the clients,
servers and peers may not all support the same cryptotypes. 
A secure NTPv4 subnet can be configured in many ways while
keeping in mind the principles explained above and
in this section. 
Note however that some cryptotype
combinations may successfully interoperate with each other,
but may not represent good security practice.

  <p>The cryptotype of an association is determined at the time
of mobilization, either at configuration time or some time
later when a message of appropriate cryptotype arrives. 
When mobilized by a
<code>server</code>
or
<code>peer</code>
configuration command and no
<code>key</code>
or
<code>autokey</code>
subcommands are present, the association is not
authenticated; if the
<code>key</code>
subcommand is present, the association is authenticated
using the symmetric key ID specified; if the
<code>autokey</code>
subcommand is present, the association is authenticated
using Autokey.

  <p>When multiple identity schemes are supported in the Autokey
protocol, the first message exchange determines which one is used. 
The client request message contains bits corresponding
to which schemes it has available. 
The server response message
contains bits corresponding to which schemes it has available. 
Both server and client match the received bits with their own
and select a common scheme.

  <p>Following the principle that time is a public value,
a server responds to any client packet that matches
its cryptotype capabilities. 
Thus, a server receiving
an unauthenticated packet will respond with an unauthenticated
packet, while the same server receiving a packet of a cryptotype
it supports will respond with packets of that cryptotype. 
However, unconfigured broadcast or manycast client
associations or symmetric passive associations will not be
mobilized unless the server supports a cryptotype compatible
with the first packet received. 
By default, unauthenticated associations will not be mobilized
unless overridden in a decidedly dangerous way.

  <p>Some examples may help to reduce confusion. 
Client Alice has no specific cryptotype selected. 
Server Bob has both a symmetric key file and minimal Autokey files. 
Alice's unauthenticated messages arrive at Bob, who replies with
unauthenticated messages. 
Cathy has a copy of Bob's symmetric
key file and has selected key ID 4 in messages to Bob. 
Bob verifies the message with his key ID 4. 
If it's the
same key and the message is verified, Bob sends Cathy a reply
authenticated with that key. 
If verification fails,
Bob sends Cathy a thing called a crypto-NAK, which tells her
something broke. 
She can see the evidence using the
<code>ntpq(1ntpqmdoc)</code>
program.

  <p>Denise has rolled her own host key and certificate. 
She also uses one of the identity schemes as Bob. 
She sends the first Autokey message to Bob and they
both dance the protocol authentication and identity steps. 
If all comes out okay, Denise and Bob continue as described above.

  <p>It should be clear from the above that Bob can support
all the girls at the same time, as long as he has compatible
authentication and identity credentials. 
Now, Bob can act just like the girls in his own choice of servers;
he can run multiple configured associations with multiple different
servers (or the same server, although that might not be useful). 
But, wise security policy might preclude some cryptotype
combinations; for instance, running an identity scheme
with one server and no authentication with another might not be wise.

<h3 class="section">Key Management</h3>

<p>The cryptographic values used by the Autokey protocol are
incorporated as a set of files generated by the
<code>ntp-keygen(1ntpkeygenmdoc)</code>
utility program, including symmetric key, host key and
public certificate files, as well as sign key, identity parameters
and leapseconds files. 
Alternatively, host and sign keys and
certificate files can be generated by the OpenSSL utilities
and certificates can be imported from public certificate
authorities. 
Note that symmetric keys are necessary for the
<code>ntpq(1ntpqmdoc)</code>
and
<code>ntpdc(1ntpdcmdoc)</code>
utility programs. 
The remaining files are necessary only for the
Autokey protocol.

  <p>Certificates imported from OpenSSL or public certificate
authorities have certian limitations. 
The certificate should be in ASN.1 syntax, X.509 Version 3
format and encoded in PEM, which is the same format
used by OpenSSL. 
The overall length of the certificate encoded
in ASN.1 must not exceed 1024 bytes. 
The subject distinguished
name field (CN) is the fully qualified name of the host
on which it is used; the remaining subject fields are ignored. 
The certificate extension fields must not contain either
a subject key identifier or a issuer key identifier field;
however, an extended key usage field for a trusted host must
contain the value
<code>trustRoot</code>;. 
Other extension fields are ignored.

Generation
file sets provide a means for handling files that are
continuously growing during the lifetime of a server. 
Server statistics are a typical example for such files. 
Generation file sets provide access to a set of files used
to store the actual data. 
At any time at most one element
of the set is being written to. 
The type given specifies
when and how data will be directed to a new element of the set. 
This way, information stored in elements of a file set
that are currently unused are available for administrational
operations without the risk of disturbing the operation of ntpd. 
(Most important: they can be removed to free space for new data
produced.)

               <dl>
name
This is the type of the statistics records, as shown in the
<code>statistics</code>
command. 
file<kbd>filename</kbd>
This is the file name for the statistics records. 
Filenames of set
members are built from three concatenated elements
<kbd>Cm</kbd><kbd>prefix</kbd>,
<kbd>Cm</kbd><kbd>filename</kbd>
and
<kbd>Cm</kbd><kbd>suffix</kbd>:
                    <dl>
prefix
This is a constant filename path. 
It is not subject to
modifications via the
<kbd>filegen</kbd>
option. 
It is defined by the
server, usually specified as a compile-time constant. 
It may,
however, be configurable for individual file generation sets
via other commands. 
For example, the prefix used with
<kbd>loopstats</kbd>
and
<kbd>peerstats</kbd>
generation can be configured using the
<kbd>statsdir</kbd>
option explained above. 
filename
This string is directly concatenated to the prefix mentioned
above (no intervening
/). 
This can be modified using
the file argument to the
<kbd>filegen</kbd>
statement. 
No
<span class="file">..</span>
elements are
allowed in this component to prevent filenames referring to
parts outside the filesystem hierarchy denoted by
<kbd>prefix</kbd>. 
suffix
This part is reflects individual elements of a file set. 
It is
generated according to the type of a file set. 
</dl>
               type<kbd>typename</kbd>
A file generation set is characterized by its type. 
The following
types are supported:
                    <dl>
none
The file set is actually a single plain file. 
pid
One element of file set is used per incarnation of a ntpd
server. 
This type does not perform any changes to file set
members during runtime, however it provides an easy way of
separating files belonging to different
<code>ntpd(1ntpdmdoc)</code>
server incarnations. 
The set member filename is built by appending a
. 
to concatenated
<kbd>prefix</kbd>
and
<kbd>filename</kbd>
strings, and
appending the decimal representation of the process ID of the
<code>ntpd(1ntpdmdoc)</code>
server process. 
day
One file generation set element is created per day. 
A day is
defined as the period between 00:00 and 24:00 UTC. 
The file set
member suffix consists of a
. 
and a day specification in
the form
<code>YYYYMMdd</code>. 
<code>YYYY</code>
is a 4-digit year number (e.g., 1992). 
<code>MM</code>
is a two digit month number. 
<code>dd</code>
is a two digit day number. 
Thus, all information written at 10 December 1992 would end up
in a file named
<kbd>prefix</kbd>
<kbd>filename</kbd><kbd>Ns</kbd><kbd>.19921210</kbd>. 
week
Any file set member contains data related to a certain week of
a year. 
The term week is defined by computing day-of-year
modulo 7. 
Elements of such a file generation set are
distinguished by appending the following suffix to the file set
filename base: A dot, a 4-digit year number, the letter
<code>W</code>,
and a 2-digit week number. 
For example, information from January,
10th 1992 would end up in a file with suffix
No.<kbd>1992W1</kbd>. 
month
One generation file set element is generated per month. 
The
file name suffix consists of a dot, a 4-digit year number, and
a 2-digit month. 
year
One generation file element is generated per year. 
The filename
suffix consists of a dot and a 4 digit year number. 
age
This type of file generation sets changes to a new element of
the file set every 24 hours of server operation. 
The filename
suffix consists of a dot, the letter
<code>a</code>,
and an 8-digit number. 
This number is taken to be the number of seconds the server is
running at the start of the corresponding 24-hour period. 
Information is only written to a file generation by specifying
<code>enable</code>;
output is prevented by specifying
<code>disable</code>. 
</dl>
               link|<code>nolink</code>
It is convenient to be able to access the current element of a file
generation set by a fixed name. 
This feature is enabled by
specifying
<code>link</code>
and disabled using
<code>nolink</code>. 
If link is specified, a
hard link from the current file set element to a file without
suffix is created. 
When there is already a file with this name and
the number of links of this file is one, it is renamed appending a
dot, the letter
<code>C</code>,
and the pid of the ntpd server process. 
When the
number of links is greater than one, the file is unlinked. 
This
allows the current file to be accessed by a constant name. 
enable<code>|</code><code>Cm</code><code>disable</code>
Enables or disables the recording function.

<h3 class="section">Access Control Support</h3>

<p>The
<code>ntpd(1ntpdmdoc)</code>
daemon implements a general purpose address/mask based restriction
list. 
The list contains address/match entries sorted first
by increasing address values and and then by increasing mask values. 
A match occurs when the bitwise AND of the mask and the packet
source address is equal to the bitwise AND of the mask and
address in the list. 
The list is searched in order with the
last match found defining the restriction flags associated
with the entry. 
Additional information and examples can be found in the
"NotesonConfiguringNTPandSettingupaNTPSubnet"
page
(available as part of the HTML documentation
provided in
<span class="file">/usr/share/doc/ntp</span>).

  <p>The restriction facility was implemented in conformance
with the access policies for the original NSFnet backbone
time servers. 
Later the facility was expanded to deflect
cryptographic and clogging attacks. 
While this facility may
be useful for keeping unwanted or broken or malicious clients
from congesting innocent servers, it should not be considered
an alternative to the NTP authentication facilities. 
Source address based restrictions are easily circumvented
by a determined cracker.

  <p>Clients can be denied service because they are explicitly
included in the restrict list created by the restrict command
or implicitly as the result of cryptographic or rate limit
violations. 
Cryptographic violations include certificate
or identity verification failure; rate limit violations generally
result from defective NTP implementations that send packets
at abusive rates. 
Some violations cause denied service
only for the offending packet, others cause denied service
for a timed period and others cause the denied service for
an indefinate period. 
When a client or network is denied access
for an indefinate period, the only way at present to remove
the restrictions is by restarting the server.

</div>

<h3 class="section">The Kiss-of-Death Packet</h3>

<p>Ordinarily, packets denied service are simply dropped with no
further action except incrementing statistics counters. 
Sometimes a
more proactive response is needed, such as a server message that
explicitly requests the client to stop sending and leave a message
for the system operator. 
A special packet format has been created
for this purpose called the "kiss-of-death" (KoD) packet. 
KoD packets have the leap bits set unsynchronized and stratum set
to zero and the reference identifier field set to a four-byte
ASCII code. 
If the
<code>noserve</code>
or
<code>notrust</code>
flag of the matching restrict list entry is set,
the code is "DENY"; if the
<code>limited</code>
flag is set and the rate limit
is exceeded, the code is "RATE". 
Finally, if a cryptographic violation occurs, the code is "CRYP".

  <p>A client receiving a KoD performs a set of sanity checks to
minimize security exposure, then updates the stratum and
reference identifier peer variables, sets the access
denied (TEST4) bit in the peer flash variable and sends
a message to the log. 
As long as the TEST4 bit is set,
the client will send no further packets to the server. 
The only way at present to recover from this condition is
to restart the protocol at both the client and server. 
This
happens automatically at the client when the association times out. 
It will happen at the server only if the server operator cooperates.

     <dl>
discard[<code>average</code><kbd>avg</kbd>][<code>minimum</code><kbd>min</kbd>][<code>monitor</code><kbd>prob</kbd>]
Set the parameters of the
<code>limited</code>
facility which protects the server from
client abuse. 
The
<code>average</code>
subcommand specifies the minimum average packet
spacing, while the
<code>minimum</code>
subcommand specifies the minimum packet spacing. 
Packets that violate these minima are discarded
and a kiss-o'-death packet returned if enabled. 
The default
minimum average and minimum are 5 and 2, respectively. 
The monitor subcommand specifies the probability of discard
for packets that overflow the rate-control window. 
restrict<code>address</code>[<code>mask</code><kbd>mask</kbd>][<kbd>flag</kbd><kbd>...</kbd>]
The
<kbd>address</kbd>
argument expressed in
dotted-quad form is the address of a host or network. 
Alternatively, the
<kbd>address</kbd>
argument can be a valid host DNS name. 
The
<kbd>mask</kbd>
argument expressed in dotted-quad form defaults to
<code>255.255.255.255</code>,
meaning that the
<kbd>address</kbd>
is treated as the address of an individual host. 
A default entry (address
<code>0.0.0.0</code>,
mask
<code>0.0.0.0</code>)
is always included and is always the first entry in the list. 
Note that text string
<code>default</code>,
with no mask option, may
be used to indicate the default entry. 
In the current implementation,
<code>flag</code>
always
restricts access, i.e., an entry with no flags indicates that free
access to the server is to be given. 
The flags are not orthogonal,
in that more restrictive flags will often make less restrictive
ones redundant. 
The flags can generally be classed into two
categories, those which restrict time service and those which
restrict informational queries and attempts to do run-time
reconfiguration of the server. 
One or more of the following flags
may be specified:
