= README file for directory attic/ =

This is a dusty attic containing code we have not quite decided to
discard.  Programs in it are not installed by default. Not much
documentation, alas.  Read the header comments.

calc_tickadj::	Calculates "optimal" value for tick given ntp.drift file
		Tested: 20160226

kern.c:: 	Header comment from deep in the mists of past time says:
		"This program simulates a first-order, type-II
		phase-lock loop using actual code segments from
		modified kernel distributions for SunOS, Ultrix and
		OSF/1 kernels. These segments do not use any licensed
		code."  Anybody who has a clue *why* it is doing this
		and what it's supposed to be used for should explain
		it to us, please.

ntpdate::	Wrapper script to maintain compatibility. Maps options
		to ntpdig and calls it.
		Tested: 20160226

ntpver::	Simple script using ntpq to print out the suite version.
		Tested: 20160226

sht.c::		Test program for shared memory refclock.
