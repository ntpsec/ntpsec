= Using NTPsec from a snap =

Snaps provide further isolation and an alternative cross-distribution mechanism
to provide applications.

Due to that isolation the tools you know are exposed to the host (your normal
system) via a prefix. For example ntpq becomes ntpseq.ntpq.

Currently the following binaries are exposed by the ntpsec snap:
 - ntpsec.ntpdig
 - ntpsec.ntpfrob
 - ntpsec.ntpkeygen
 - ntpsec.ntpq
 - ntpsec.ntptime

Additionally ntpd is exposed as a daemon (via a systemd service).
It can be accessed via the usual tools as snap.ntpsec.ntpd.service.

Examples:
 1. get status / start / stop / restart
   $ systemctl status snap.ntpsec.ntpd.service

 2. check the log just for this service
   $ journalctl -u snap.ntpsec.ntpd

// end
