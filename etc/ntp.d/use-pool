# If you have no other local chimers to help NTP perform sanity checks

# iburst tells it to send the first few requests at 2 second intervals rather
# than wait for the poll interval, which defaults to 64 seconds.  That greatly
# speeds up the time for ntpd to set the system time and start responding to
# requests.

# You can speed up initialization, and spread the load better, by
# using a country-specific potion of the pool, e.g. something like
#
# us.pool.ntp.org
# 
# If you are not in the USA, then it will probably work to
# change the 'us' to your two letter country code.

# Major Internet-using countries with pools include:

# If you don't know your country code, find it at

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1
#
# and then try prepending it to ".pool.ntp.org" and pinging that.
