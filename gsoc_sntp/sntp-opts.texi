.I sntp
can be used as a SNTP client to query a NTP or SNTP server and either display
the time or set the local system's time (given suitable privilege).  It can be
run as an interactive command or in a
.I cron
job.
NTP is the Network Time Protocol (RFC 1305) and SNTP is the
Simple Network Time Protocol (RFC 2030, which supersedes RFC 1769).

This section was generated by @strong{AutoGen},
the aginfo template and the option descriptions for the @command{sntp} program.  It documents the sntp usage text and option meanings.

@node sntp ipv4
@subsection ipv4 option (-4)
@cindex sntp-ipv4

This is the ``force ipv4 dns name resolution'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
is a member of the ipv4 class of options.
@end itemize

Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
to the IPv4 namespace.

@node sntp ipv6
@subsection ipv6 option (-6)
@cindex sntp-ipv6

This is the ``force ipv6 dns name resolution'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
is a member of the ipv4 class of options.
@end itemize

Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
to the IPv6 namespace.

@node sntp normalverbose
@subsection normalverbose option (-d)
@cindex sntp-normalverbose

This is the ``normal verbose'' option.
Diagnostic messages for non-fatal errors and a limited amount of
tracing should be written to standard error.  Fatal ones always
produce a diagnostic.  This option should be set when there is a
suspected problem with the server, network or the source.

@node sntp kod
@subsection kod option (-K)
@cindex sntp-kod

This is the ``specify a file for the kod packet storage'' option.
Specifies the file to be used to store KOD packaet information.

@node sntp syslog
@subsection syslog option (-p)
@cindex sntp-syslog

This is the ``logging with syslog'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
filelog.
@end itemize

When this option is set all logging will be done using syslog.

@node sntp filelog
@subsection filelog option (-l)
@cindex sntp-filelog

This is the ``logging to specified logfile'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
syslog.
@end itemize

This option causes the client to write log messages to the specified
logfile. 

@node sntp settod
@subsection settod option (-s)
@cindex sntp-settod

This is the ``set (step) the time with settimeofday()'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
adjtime.
@end itemize



@node sntp adjtime
@subsection adjtime option (-j)
@cindex sntp-adjtime

This is the ``set (slew) the time with adjtime()'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
settod.
@end itemize



@node sntp broadcast
@subsection broadcast option (-b)
@cindex sntp-broadcast

This is the ``use broadcast packages from the broadcast address specified for synchronisation'' option.
If specified SNTP will wait 1 minute for broadcast packets
from the broadcast address specified for synchronisation. 
The amount of time SNTP waits can be specified with -t.

@node sntp timeout
@subsection timeout option (-t)
@cindex sntp-timeout

This is the ``specify the number of seconds until sntp times out when waiting for broadcast packets'' option.
When waiting for a broadcast packet SNTP will wait the number 
of seconds specified and times out.

@node sntp authentication
@subsection authentication option (-a)
@cindex sntp-authentication

This is the ``enable authentication with the key keyno. this option is used as -a keyno'' option.
This option enables authentication using the key specified in this option\'s argument.
The argument of this option is the keyid, a number specified in the keyfile as this
key\'s identifier. See the keyfile option -k for more details.

@node sntp keyfile
@subsection keyfile option (-k)
@cindex sntp-keyfile

This is the ``specify a keyfile. sntp will look in this file for the key specified with -a'' option.
This option specifies the keyfile. SNTP will search for the key specified with -a keyno in this 
file. Key files follow the following format:

keyid keytype key

Where 	keyid is a number identifying this key
keytype is one of the follow:
S  Key in 64 Bit hexadecimal number as specified in in the DES specification.
N  Key in 64 Bit hexadecimal number as specified in the NTP standard.
A  Key in a 1-to-8 character ASCII string.
M  Key in a 1-to-8 character ASCII string using the MD5 authentication scheme.
