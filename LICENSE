= Software licenses =

For historical reasons the code in this distribution is issued under
several different but compatible licenses.  Each will generally be
found near a year or years of copyright declaration.

Much of the existing and historical code is licensed under the "NTP
License".  Additionally, small portions of the code are licensed under
the BSD 3-clause and MIT licenses.

Our preferred license for new code contributions is BSD 2-clause.

Our preferred license for documentation is Creative Commons Attribution 4.0.

Refer to .../docs/copyright.txt for more information about copyrights,
licensing, and contributor credits.

A great deal of effort has been spent researching old file archives
and old source control data sets and then integrating and correcting
it all into the git history of this repository.  As near as we can
tell, this git repo contains all of the currently surviving
history of the NTP reference implementation.  If you know of or
possess tarballs or source trees of the project that are not contained
in this git repo, please let us know, so that we can add them.
