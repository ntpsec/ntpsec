== NAME ==
sntp - standard Simple Network Time Protocol client program
== SYNOPSIS ==
sntp [-flag [value]]... [--opt-name [[=| ]value]]... [ hostname-or-IP ...]
== DESCRIPTION ==

`sntp` can be used as an SNTP client to query a NTP or SNTP server and
either display the time or set the local system's time (given suitable
privilege). It can be run as an interactive command or from a _cron_
job. NTP (the Network Time Protocol) and SNTP (the Simple Network Time
Protocol) are defined and described by RFC 5905.

The default is to write the estimated correct local date and time (i.e.
not UTC) to the standard output in a format like:
'1996-10-15 20:17:25.123 (+0800) +4.567 +/- 0.089 secs' where the
_'(+0800)'_ means that to get to UTC from the reported local time one
must add 8 hours and 0 minutes, the _'+4.567'_ indicates the local clock
is 4.567 seconds behind the correct time (so 4.567 seconds must be added
to the local clock to get it to be correct). Note that the number of
decimals printed for this value will change based on the reported
precision of the server. _'+/- 0.089'_ is the reported _synchronization_
_distance_ (in seconds), which represents the maximum error due to all
causes. If the server does not report valid data needed to calculate the
synchronization distance, this will be reported as _'+/- ?'_. If the
_host_ is different from the _IP_, both will be displayed. Otherwise,
only the _IP_ is displayed. Finally, the _stratum_ of the host is
reported and the leap indicator is decoded and displayed.

= OPTIONS

`-4`, `--ipv4`::
  Force IPv4 DNS name resolution. This option must not appear in
  combination with any of the following options: ipv6.
+
Force DNS resolution of the following host names on the command line
to the IPv4 namespace.

`-6`, `--ipv6`::
  Force IPv6 DNS name resolution. This option must not appear in
  combination with any of the following options: ipv4.
+
Force DNS resolution of the following host names on the command line
to the IPv6 namespace.

`-a` auth-keynumber, `--authentication`=_auth-keynumber_::
  Enable authentication with the key _auth-keynumber_. This option takes
  an integer number as its argument.
  +
Enable authentication using the key specified in this option's
argument. The argument of this option is the _keyid_, a number
specified in the _keyfile_ as this key's identifier. See the _keyfile_
option (`-k`) for more details.

`-b` broadcast-address, `--broadcast`=_broadcast-address_::
  Listen to the address specified for broadcast time sync. This option
  may appear an unlimited number of times.
+
If specified `sntp` will listen to the specified address for NTP
broadcasts. The default maximum wait time can (and probably should) be
modified with `-t`.

`-c` host-name, `--concurrent`=_host-name_::
  Concurrently query all IPs returned for host-name. This option may
  appear an unlimited number of times.
+
Requests from an NTP "client" to a "server" should never be sent more
rapidly than one every 2 seconds. By default, any IPs returned as part
of a DNS lookup are assumed to be for a single instance of _ntpd_, and
therefore `sntp` will send queries to these IPs one after another,
with a 2-second gap in between each query.
+
The `-c` or `--concurrent` flag says that any IPs returned for the DNS
lookup of the supplied host-name are on different machines, so we can
send concurrent queries.

`-d`, `--debug-level`::
  Increase debug verbosity level. This option may appear an unlimited
  number of times.

`-D` number, `--set-debug-level`=_number_::
  Set the debug verbosity level. This option may appear an unlimited
  number of times. This option takes an integer number as its argument.

`-g` milliseconds, `--gap`=_milliseconds_::
  The gap (in milliseconds) between time requests. This option takes an
  integer number as its argument. The default _milliseconds_ for this
  option is:
+
__
50
__
+
Since we're only going to use the first valid response we get and
there is benefit to specifying a good number of servers to query,
separate the queries we send out by the specified number of
milliseconds.

`-K` file-name, `--kod`=_file-name_::
  KoD history filename. The default _file-name_ for this option is:
+
_______________
/var/db/ntp-kod
_______________
+
Specifies the filename to be used for the persistent history of KoD
responses received from servers. If the file does not exist, a warning
message will be displayed. The file will not be created.

`-k` file-name, `--keyfile`=_file-name_::
  Look in this file for the key specified with `-a`.
+
This option specifies the keyfile. `sntp` will search for the key
specified with `-a` keyno in this file. See _ntp.keys(5)_ for more
information.

`-l` file-name, `--logfile`=_file-name_::
  Log to specified logfile.
+
This option causes the client to write log messages to the specified
_logfile_.

`-M` number, `--steplimit`=_number_::
  Adjustments less than _steplimit_ msec will be slewed. This option
  takes an integer number as its argument. The value of _number_ is
  constrained to being:
+
--------------------------

greater than or equal to 0
--------------------------
+
If the time adjustment is less than _steplimit_ milliseconds, slew the
amount using _adjtime(2)_. Otherwise, step the correction using
_settimeofday(2)_. The default value is 0, which means all adjustments
will be stepped. This is a feature, as different situations demand
different values.

`-o` number, `--ntpversion`=_number_::
  Send _int_ as our NTP protocol version. This option takes an integer
  number as its argument. The value of _number_ is constrained to being:
+
-------------------------

in the range  0 through 7
-------------------------
+
The default _number_ for this option is:
+
_
4
_
+
When sending requests to a remote server, tell them we are running NTP
protocol version _ntpversion_ .

`-r`, `--usereservedport`::
  Use the NTP Reserved Port (port 123).
+
Use port 123, which is reserved for NTP, for our network
communications.

`-S`, `--step`::
  OK to 'step' the time with _settimeofday(2)_.

`-s`, `--slew`::
  OK to 'slew' the time with _adjtime(2)_.

`-t` seconds, `--timeout`=_seconds_::
  The number of seconds to wait for responses. This option takes an
  integer number as its argument. The default _seconds_ for this option
  is: 5.
+
When waiting for a reply, `sntp` will wait the number of seconds
specified before giving up. The default should be more than enough for
a unicast response. If `sntp` is only waiting for a broadcast response
a longer timeout is likely needed.

`--wait`, `- Fl -no-wait`::
  Wait for pending replies (if not setting the time). The _no-wait_ form
  will disable the option. This option is enabled by default.
+
If we are not setting the time, wait for all pending responses.

`--version`::
  Output version of program and exit.

== USAGE ==

_sntp ntpserver.somewhere_::
  is the simplest use of this program and can be run as an unprivileged
  command to check the current time and error in the local clock.
_sntp -Ss -M 128 ntpserver.somewhere_::
  With suitable privilege, run as a command or from a _cron_(8) job,
  `sntp -Ss -M 128 ntpserver.somewhere` will request the time from the
  server, and if that server reports that it is synchronized then if the
  offset adjustment is less than 128 milliseconds the correction will be
  slewed, and if the correction is more than 128 milliseconds the
  correction will be stepped.
_sntp -S ntpserver.somewhere_::
  With suitable privilege, run as a command or from a _cron_(8) job,
  `sntp -S ntpserver.somewhere` will set (step) the local clock from a
  synchronized specified server, like the (deprecated)
  _ntpdate_(@NTPDATE_MS@), or _rdate_(8) commands.

== EXIT STATUS ==

One of the following exit values will be returned:

0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)::
  Successful program execution.
1 (EXIT_FAILURE)::
  The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
