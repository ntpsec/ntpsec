.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page briefly documents the \fBsntp\fP command.
.I sntp
can be used as a SNTP client to query a NTP or SNTP server and either display
the time or set the local system's time (given suitable privilege).  It can be
run as an interactive command or in a
.I cron
job.

NTP (the Network Time Protocol) and SNTP (the Simple Network Time Protocol)
are defined and described by RFC 5905.

.PP
The default is to write the estimated correct local date and time (i.e. not
UTC) to the standard output in a format like
.BR "'1996-10-15 20:17:25.123 (+0800) +4.567 +/- 0.089 secs'" ,
where the
.B "'(+0800)'"
means that to get to UTC from the reported local time one must
add 8 hours and 0 minutes,
and the
.B "'+4.567 +/- 0.089 secs'"
indicates the local clock is 4.567 seconds behind the correct time
(so 4.567 seconds must be added to the local clock to get it to be correct),
and the time of
'1996-10-15 20:17:25.123'
is believed to be correct to within
+/- 0.089
seconds.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-d ", " \--debug-level
Increase output debug message level.
This option may appear an unlimited number of times.
.sp
Increase the debugging message output level.
.TP
.BR \-D " \fIstring\fP, " \--set-debug-level "=" \fIstring\fP
Set the output debug message level.
This option may appear an unlimited number of times.
.sp
Set the output debugging level.  Can be supplied multiple times,
but each overrides the previous value(s).
.TP
.BR \-4 ", " \--ipv4
Force IPv4 DNS name resolution.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
ipv6.
.sp
Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
to the IPv4 namespace.
.TP
.BR \-6 ", " \--ipv6
Force IPv6 DNS name resolution.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
ipv4.
.sp
Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
to the IPv6 namespace.
.TP
.BR \-a " \fIauth-keynumber\fP, " \--authentication "=" \fIauth-keynumber\fP
Enable authentication with the key auth-keynumber.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
.sp
This option enables authentication using the key specified in this option's argument.
The argument of this option is the keyid, a number specified in the keyfile as this
key's identifier. See the keyfile option (-k) for more details.
.TP
.BR \-B " \fIseconds\fP, " \--bctimeout "=" \fIseconds\fP
The number of seconds to wait for broadcasts.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The default \fIseconds\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 68
.sp
When waiting for a broadcast packet SNTP will wait the number
of seconds specified before giving up.  Default 68 seconds.
.TP
.BR \-b " \fIbroadcast-address\fP, " \--broadcast "=" \fIbroadcast-address\fP
Listen to the address specified for broadcast time sync.
This option may appear an unlimited number of times.
.sp
If specified SNTP will listen to the specified address
for NTP broadcasts.  The default maximum wait time,
68 seconds, can be modified with \-B.
.TP
.BR \-c " \fIhost-name\fP, " \--concurrent "=" \fIhost-name\fP
Concurrent query all IPs returned for host-name.
This option may appear an unlimited number of times.
.sp
Requests from an NTP "client" to a "server" should never be sent
more rapidly than one every 2 seconds.  By default, any IPs returned
as part of a DNS lookup are assumed to be for a single instance of
ntpd, and therefore sntp will send  queries to these IPs one after
another, with a 2-second gap in between each query.

The \-c or \--concurrent flag says that any IPs returned for the
DNS lookup of the supplied host-name are on different machines,
so we can send concurrent queries.
.TP
.BR \-h " \fImilliseconds\fP, " \--headspace "=" \fImilliseconds\fP
The gap (in milliseconds) between time requests.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The default \fImilliseconds\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 10
.sp
Since we're only going to use the first valid response we get and
there is benefit to specifying a good number of servers to query,
separate the queries we send out by the specified number of
milliseconds.
Default 10 milliseconds.
.TP
.BR \-K " \fIfile-name\fP, " \--kod "=" \fIfile-name\fP
KoD history filename.
The default \fIfile-name\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 /var/db/ntp-kod
.sp
Specifies the filename to be used for the  persistent history of KoD
responses received from servers.  The default is
/var/db/ntp-kod.
.TP
.BR \-k " \fIfile-name\fP, " \--keyfile "=" \fIfile-name\fP
Look in this file for the key specified with \-a.
.sp
This option specifies the keyfile. SNTP will search for the key specified with \-a keyno in this
file. Key files follow the following format:

keyid keytype key

Where	keyid is a number identifying this key
keytype is one of the follow:
S  Key in 64 Bit hexadecimal number as specified in in the DES specification.
N  Key in 64 Bit hexadecimal number as specified in the NTP standard.
A  Key in a 1-to-8 character ASCII string.
M  Key in a 1-to-8 character ASCII string using the MD5 authentication scheme.

For more information see ntp.keys(5).
.TP
.BR \-l " \fIfile-name\fP, " \--filelog "=" \fIfile-name\fP
Log to specified logfile.
.sp
This option causes the client to write log messages to the specified
logfile.
.TP
.BR \-M " \fInumber\fP, " \--steplimit "=" \fInumber\fP
Adjustments less than steplimit msec will be slewed..
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fInumber\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
greater than or equal to 0
.fi
.in -4
.sp
If the time adjustment is less than steplimit milliseconds, slew the amount using adjtime().  Otherwise, step the correction using settimeofday().
.TP
.BR \-o " \fInumber\fP, " \--ntpversion "=" \fInumber\fP
Send <int> as our NTP version.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The value of \fInumber\fP is constrained to being:
.in +4
.nf
.na
in the range  0 through 7
.fi
.in -4
The default \fInumber\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 4
.sp
When sending requests to a remote server, tell them we are running
NTP protocol version <ntpversion> .
.TP
.BR \-r ", " \--usereservedport
Use the NTP Reserved Port (port 123).
.sp
Use port 123, which is reserved for NTP, for our network communications.
.TP
.BR \-S ", " \--step
OK to 'step' the time with settimeofday().
.sp

.TP
.BR \-s ", " \--slew
OK to 'slew' the time with adjtime().
.sp

.TP
.BR \-u " \fIseconds\fP, " \--uctimeout "=" \fIseconds\fP
The number of seconds to wait for unicast responses.
This option takes an integer number as its argument.
The default \fIseconds\fP for this option is:
.ti +4
 5
.sp
When waiting for a unicast reply, SNTP will wait the number
of seconds specified before giving up.  Default 5 seconds.
.TP
.BR \--wait, " \fB--no-wait\fP"
Wait for pending replies (if not setting the time).
The \fIno-wait\fP form will disable the option.
This option is enabled by default.
.sp
If we are not setting the time, wait for all pending responses.
.TP
.BR \-? , " \--help"
Display extended usage information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-! , " \--more-help"
Extended usage information passed thru pager.
.TP
.BR \-> " [\fIrcfile\fP]," " \--save-opts" "[=\fIrcfile\fP]"
Save the option state to \fIrcfile\fP.  The default is the \fIlast\fP
configuration file listed in the \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP section, below.
.TP
.BR \-< " \fIrcfile\fP," " \--load-opts" "=\fIrcfile\fP," " \--no-load-opts"
Load options from \fIrcfile\fP.
The \fIno-load-opts\fP form will disable the loading
of earlier RC/INI files.  \fI--no-load-opts\fP is handled early,
out of order.
.TP
.BR \- " [{\fIv|c|n\fP}]," " \--version" "[=\fI{v|c|n}\fP]"
Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple
version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will
print the full copyright notice.
.SH OPTION PRESETS
Any option that is not marked as \fInot presettable\fP may be preset
by loading values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s) and values from
environment variables named:
.nf
  \fBSNTP_<option-name>\fP or \fBSNTP\fP
.fi
.ad
The environmental presets take precedence (are processed later than)
the configuration files.
The \fIhomerc\fP files are "\fI$HOME\fP", and "\fI.\fP".
If any of these are directories, then the file \fI.ntprc\fP
is searched for within those directories.
.SH USAGE
The simplest use of this program is as an unprivileged command to check the
current time and error in the local clock.  For example:
.IP
.B sntp ntpserver.somewhere
.PP
With suitable privilege, it can be run as a command or in a
.I cron
job to reset the local clock from a reliable server, like the
.I ntpdate
and
.I rdate
commands.  For example:
.IP
.B sntp \-a ntpserver.somewhere
.SH RETURN VALUE
The program returns a zero exit
status for success, and a non-zero one otherwise.
