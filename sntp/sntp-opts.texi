.I sntp
can be used as a SNTP client to query a NTP or SNTP server and either display
the time or set the local system's time (given suitable privilege).  It can be
run as an interactive command or in a
.I cron
job.
NTP is the Network Time Protocol (RFC 1305) and SNTP is the
Simple Network Time Protocol (RFC 2030, which supersedes RFC 1769).

This section was generated by @strong{AutoGen},
the aginfo template and the option descriptions for the @command{sntp} program.  It documents the sntp usage text and option meanings.

@node sntp ipv4
@subsection ipv4 option (-4)
@cindex sntp-ipv4

This is the ``force ipv4 dns name resolution'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
is a member of the ipv4 class of options.
@end itemize

Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
to the IPv4 namespace.

@node sntp ipv6
@subsection ipv6 option (-6)
@cindex sntp-ipv6

This is the ``force ipv6 dns name resolution'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
is a member of the ipv4 class of options.
@end itemize

Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
to the IPv6 namespace.

@node sntp normalverbose
@subsection normalverbose option (-d)
@cindex sntp-normalverbose

This is the ``normal verbose'' option.
Diagnostic messages for non-fatal errors and a limited amount of
tracing should be written to standard error.  Fatal ones always
produce a diagnostic.  This option should be set when there is a
suspected problem with the server, network or the source.

@node sntp kod
@subsection kod option (-K)
@cindex sntp-kod

This is the ``kod history filename'' option.
Modifies the filename to be used to persist the history of KoD
responses received from servers.  The default is
/var/db/ntp-kod.

@node sntp syslog
@subsection syslog option (-p)
@cindex sntp-syslog

This is the ``logging with syslog'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
filelog.
@end itemize

When this option is set all logging will be done using syslog.

@node sntp filelog
@subsection filelog option (-l)
@cindex sntp-filelog

This is the ``logging to specified logfile'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
syslog.
@end itemize

This option causes the client to write log messages to the specified
logfile. 

@node sntp settod
@subsection settod option (-s)
@cindex sntp-settod

This is the ``set (step) the time with settimeofday()'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
adjtime.
@end itemize



@node sntp adjtime
@subsection adjtime option (-j)

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
settod.
@end itemize



@node sntp broadcast
@subsection broadcast option (-b)
@cindex sntp-broadcast

This is the ``use broadcasts to the address specified for synchronisation'' option.
If specified SNTP will listen for NTP broadcasts to the
specified broadcast address.  The default maximum wait time,
68 seconds, can be modified with -t.

@node sntp timeout
@subsection timeout option (-t)
@cindex sntp-timeout

This is the ``specify the number of seconds to wait for broadcasts'' option.
When waiting for a broadcast packet SNTP will wait the number 
of seconds specified before giving up.  Default 68 seconds.

@node sntp authentication
@subsection authentication option (-a)
@cindex sntp-authentication

This is the ``enable authentication with the key keyno. this option is used as -a keyno'' option.
This option enables authentication using the key specified in this option\'s argument.
The argument of this option is the keyid, a number specified in the keyfile as this
key\'s identifier. See the keyfile option -k for more details.

@node sntp keyfile
@subsection keyfile option (-k)
@cindex sntp-keyfile

This is the ``specify a keyfile. sntp will look in this file for the key specified with -a'' option.
This option specifies the keyfile. SNTP will search for the key specified with -a keyno in this 
file. Key files follow the following format:

keyid keytype key

Where 	keyid is a number identifying this key
keytype is one of the follow:
S  Key in 64 Bit hexadecimal number as specified in in the DES specification.
N  Key in 64 Bit hexadecimal number as specified in the NTP standard.
A  Key in a 1-to-8 character ASCII string.
M  Key in a 1-to-8 character ASCII string using the MD5 authentication scheme.

See more information see ntp.keys(5).
