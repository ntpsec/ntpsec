@code{sntp}
can be used as a SNTP client to query a NTP or SNTP server and either display
the time or set the local system's time (given suitable privilege).  It can be
run as an interactive command or in a
@code{cron}
job.

NTP (the Network Time Protocol) and SNTP (the Simple Network Time Protocol)
are defined and described by RFC 5905.

@indent
The default is to write the estimated correct local date and time (i.e. not
UTC) to the standard output in a format like
@example
1996-10-15 20:17:25.123 (+0800) +4.567 +/- 0.089 secs
@end example
where the
@example
+4.567 +/- 0.089 secs
@end example
indicates the local clock is 4.567 seconds behind the correct time
(so 4.567 seconds must be added to the local clock to get it to be correct),
and the (local) time of
@code{1996-10-15 20:17:25.123}
can be converted to UTC time by adding 8 hours and 0 minutes, and
is believed to be correct to within
@code{+/- 0.089}
seconds.

sntp implements the Simple Network Time Protocol and is used to query
an NTP or SNTP server and either display the time or set the local
system's time (given suitable privilege).

It can be run interactively from the command line or as a cron job.

NTP and SNTP are defined by RFC 5905, which obsoletes RFC 4330 and RFC
1305.

@exampleindent 4

@node sntp adjtime
@subsection adjtime option (-j)
@cindex sntp-adjtime

This is the ``set (slew) the time with adjtime()'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
settod, steplimit.
@end itemize



@node sntp authentication
@subsection authentication option (-a)
@cindex sntp-authentication

This is the ``enable authentication with the key auth-keynumber'' option.
This option enables authentication using the key specified in this option's argument.
The argument of this option is the keyid, a number specified in the keyfile as this
key's identifier. See the keyfile option (-k) for more details.

@node sntp broadcast
@subsection broadcast option (-b)
@cindex sntp-broadcast

This is the ``use broadcasts to the address specified for synchronisation'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
may appear an unlimited number of times.
@end itemize

If specified SNTP will listen to the specified broadcast address
for NTP broadcasts.  The default maximum wait time,
68 seconds, can be modified with -t.

@node sntp concurrent
@subsection concurrent option (-c)
@cindex sntp-concurrent

This is the ``send concurrent queries to all ips returned for host-name'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
may appear an unlimited number of times.
@end itemize

Requests from an NTP "client" to a "server" should never be sent
more rapidly than one every 2 seconds.  By default, any IPs returned
as part of a DNS lookup are assumed to be for a single instance of
ntpd, and therefore sntp will send  queries to these IPs one after
another, with a 2-second gap in between each query.

The -c or --concurrent flag says that any IPs returned for the
DNS lookup of the supplied host-name are on different machines,
so we can send concurrent queries.

@node sntp debug-level
@subsection debug-level option (-d)
@cindex sntp-debug-level

This is the ``increase output debug message level'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
may appear an unlimited number of times.
@end itemize

Increase the debugging message output level.

@node sntp filelog
@subsection filelog option (-l)
@cindex sntp-filelog

This is the ``log to specified logfile'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
syslog.
@end itemize

This option causes the client to write log messages to the specified
logfile.

@node sntp ipv4
@subsection ipv4 option (-4)
@cindex sntp-ipv4

This is the ``force ipv4 dns name resolution'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
ipv6.
@end itemize

Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
to the IPv4 namespace.

@node sntp ipv6
@subsection ipv6 option (-6)
@cindex sntp-ipv6

This is the ``force ipv6 dns name resolution'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
ipv4.
@end itemize

Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
to the IPv6 namespace.

@node sntp keyfile
@subsection keyfile option (-k)
@cindex sntp-keyfile

This is the ``specify a keyfile. sntp will look in this file for the key specified with -a'' option.
This option specifies the keyfile. SNTP will search for the key specified with -a keyno in this
file. Key files follow the following format:

keyid keytype key

Where	keyid is a number identifying this key
keytype is one of the follow:
S  Key in 64 Bit hexadecimal number as specified in in the DES specification.
N  Key in 64 Bit hexadecimal number as specified in the NTP standard.
A  Key in a 1-to-8 character ASCII string.
M  Key in a 1-to-8 character ASCII string using the MD5 authentication scheme.

For more information see ntp.keys(5).

@node sntp kod
@subsection kod option (-K)

Specifies the filename to be used for the  persistent history of KoD
responses received from servers.  The default is
/var/db/ntp-kod.

@node sntp set-debug-level
@subsection set-debug-level option (-D)
@cindex sntp-set-debug-level

This is the ``set the output debug message level'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
may appear an unlimited number of times.
@end itemize

Set the output debugging level.  Can be supplied multiple times,
but each overrides the previous value(s).

@node sntp settod
@subsection settod option (-s)
@cindex sntp-settod

This is the ``set (step) the time with settimeofday()'' option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
@itemize @bullet
@item
must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
adjtime, settod.
@end itemize

If the time adjustment is less than steplimit milliseconds, slew the amount using adjtime().  Otherwise, step the correction using settimeofday().
