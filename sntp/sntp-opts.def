can be used as an SNTP client to query a NTP or SNTP server and either display
the time or set the local system's time (given suitable privilege).  It can be
run as an interactive command or in a
.Ic cron
job.

NTP (the Network Time Protocol) and SNTP (the Simple Network Time Protocol)
are defined and described by RFC 5905.

.PP
The default is to write the estimated correct local date and time (i.e. not
UTC) to the standard output in a format like:

.Ic "'1996-10-15 20:17:25.123 (+0800) +4.567 +/- 0.089 secs'"

where the
.Ic "'(+0800)'"
means that to get to UTC from the reported local time one must
add 8 hours and 0 minutes,
and the
.Ic "'+4.567 +/- 0.089 secs'"
indicates the local clock is 4.567 seconds behind the correct time
(so 4.567 seconds must be added to the local clock to get it to be correct),
and the date/time of
'1996-10-15 20:17:25.123'
is believed to be correct to within
+/- 0.089
seconds.
