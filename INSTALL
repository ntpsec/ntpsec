Quick Start
===========

Go to the directory where you found this file and do this:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ./waf configure
$ ./waf build
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic Installation
==================

These are generic Unix installation instructions.

For Windows/NT, please see ports/winnt and html/build/hints/winnt.html.
(Note: The Windows build may be broken.  If so, we do not yet have an
active Windows port maintainer and the build will be fixed when we
have one.)

You will need Python 2.5 or later installed to make the build work.

Under Unix, the simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and

  2. Run `waf configure' to configure the package for your system.  

  3. Type `waf build' to compile the package.

  4. Type `waf install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `waf clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `waf configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `waf distclean'.

Installation Names
==================

By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving waf the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

Optional Features
=================

The waf builder accepts `--enable-FEATURE' options to where FEATURE
indicates an optional part of the package.  Do `waf --help' for a list
of options.

Operation Controls
==================

The waf builder recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `waf configure', and exit.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.
