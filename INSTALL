== Prerequisites ==

This software should build on any operating system conformant to
POSIX.1-2001 and ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (C99).  In addition, the operating
system must have an ntp_adjtime(2) call. Also, it must support the
IPv6 API defined in RFC 2493 and RFC 2553. Finally, it must support
iterating over active UDP interfaces via getifaddrs(3) or some
equivalent facility.

You can browse a summary of differences from legacy NTP here:

https://docs.ntpsec.org/latest/ntpsec.html

There are some prerequisites.  Libraries need the binary installed
to run and in addition, the development headers installed to build.

=== The short version ===

If you are on a Debian or Ubuntu distribution that uses apt-get, or on
a Fedora or RedHat distribution that uses yum or dnf, or a Suse
distribution that uses yast or zypper, or Gentoo, you can use the
./buildprep script.

In that case, run ./buildprep -n to see what needs to be installed as
prerequisites on your system.  In order that we have a single point of
truth about package requirements, much information about
installable-package names that used to live in this file has moved to
that script.

If you are using other distributions or OSes, such as macOS, Solaris,
or *BSD, you will have to install the build prerequisites by hand on
your system.  Read the buildprep script to get an idea what packages
are required.

buildprep does not attempt to install dependencies for optional
components like ntpviz or building documentation unless asked. See
buildprep --help for details on available options.  asciidoc has a
huge tail of dependencies and you probably don't want it unless you're
planning to modify the documentation.  psutil may require different
packages depending on whether your base Python version is 2 or 3.

=== Details ===

Python 2.x, x >= 6, or Python 3.x, x >= 3::
   Required to build, and for various scripts such as ntpviz (but see
   the guidance for packagers in devel/packaging.txt).  Our Python code
   has been written polyglot to also run with production versions of
   Python 3.  Note that you will need both the ordinary Python
   installation and Python dev tools, if your OS makes such a
   distinction.

argparse::
   Required for ntpviz when using Python version 2.6
   Install with pip: pip install argparse

psutil::
   Optional for ntpviz.  Allows running with ionice()
   Debian: python-psutil or python3-psutil
   Ubuntu: python-psutil or python3-psutil
   Fedora/CentOS: python-psutil
   CentOS 6: python-psutil in epel ("Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux").
   Gentoo: dev-python/psutil
   SLES: python-psutil

sys/timepps.h::
   If you are building to supply Stratum 1 time service (that is, with
   refclocks linked in) you may find that you need the sys/timepps.h
   file to be installed, depending on which refclocks you enable.
   This won't be necessary for pure client (Stratum 2 or higher)
   installations.

asciidoc, a2x::
   You will need asciidoc to make HTML and a2x to make manual pages from the
   documentation masters.  Only required if you configured with --enable-doc.
   Note, you need asciidoc 8.6.0 at minimum.
   Debian/Ubuntu: asciidoc
   Fedora/CentOS: asciidoc  (CentOS/RHEL6 has only 8.4.5, you must upgrade)
   Gentoo: app-text/asciidoc
   SLES: asciidoc

Local copy of DocBook stylesheets:
   Optional: Prevents documentation build failures when your Internet is down
   Debian/Ubuntu: docbook-xsl
   Fedora/CentOS: docbook-xsl-stylesheets
   Gentoo: app-text/docbook-xsl-stylesheets
   SLES: docbook-xsl-stylesheets - pulled in by `asciidoc`

wget:
   Optional, used by ntpleapfetch

== Basic Installation ==

These are generic Unix installation instructions.  Some notes on
specific platforms follow this section.

Under Unix, the simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and

  2. Run `./buildprep' as root to get your prerequisites installed.

  3. Run `./waf configure' to configure the package for your system.
  You may want to add configuration options after the verb 'configure';
  see below.

  4. Invoke `./waf build' to compile the package.

  5. Invoke `./waf install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  6. You can uninstall cleanly by invoking `./waf uninstall' as root.

  7. Look under "Boot script setup" in wscript for how to set up
     boot time startup of ntpd; this will vary according to your
     init system.

  8. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `./waf clean'.

  9. To also remove the files that `./waf configure' created (so you can
     configure and compile the package for a different kind of
     computer), type `./waf distclean'.

=== Solaris ===

When building the NTPsec suite using gcc under Solaris, you may see
prototype-mismatch warnings involving adjtime(2).  These warnings are
functionally harmless and can be ignored.  They reflect an unfortunate
choice by Solaris not to const the function's first argument as do
other implementations.

== Build Bugs ==

The configuration system occasionally acts up during builds on new
platforms.  If you see the message "Compilation check failed but
include exists!" this means that an attempt to compile a small test
program using the include header mentioned on the previous line
failed, but waf configure then found that despite this the header file
exists on your system.

When this happens, it is likely that the header has prerequisites
on your system that waf configure doesn't know about - that is,
other headers always need to be included before it in C programs.
Please report this as a bug, along with your platform details.

== Source build limitations ==

When you do an install from source, no attempt is made to generate an
/etc/ntp.conf for you.  The reason is that we, the maintainers, can't
know what pool host you are authorized to use.  If you have an existing
ntp.conf from a legacy version, you can expect it to work.

Due to a limitation of the Python distutils library, if you install
from the source distribution with prefix set to a value other than
/usr (in particular, if it's the default value /usr/local), that
prefix will be honored *only if the corresponding Python library
directory already exists*. Otherwise, under Linux, the install will
drop the ntp Python library in /usr/lib. This layout may violate the
Linux File Hierarchy Standard.

You should have neither issue if you install from an OS distribution's
binary package.

== Caveat for Crossbuilders ==

If you see a build failure with the message "error: No repo or cache
detected.", you have collided with an unusual feature of our build recipe.

To generate the version.h file, the uses a script called
'autorevision.sh' which needs one of two preconditions.  Either (1)
you are building in a local repository clone, or (2) you are building
from an unpacked release tarball containing a file
wafhelpers/.autorevision-cache containing version information.

The motivation for this behavior is to have a version string that
makes sense on every build from either the repository or a release
tarball.  It means, however, that if you try to build when waf can see
neither of these things, you'll get the "No repo or cache detected"
error.  This can happen when atrempting to use a remote buildroot for
cross-compilation or other purposes

There are a couple of possible workarounds.  One is to do your remote build
from a release tarball.  Another is to do a ./waf configure and build in the
source directory before attempting a buildroot build.

== Installation Names ==

By default, `waf install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving waf the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

If you do so, please also modify the prefixdir variable in
docs/asciidoc.conf, so that the documentation is built pointing
to your new location.

You should read the section "Path problems with the test tools" in
devel/testing.txt before setting a non-default prefix.

There is a separate `--destdir' option that changes the root of the
entire installation hierarchy, prepending all paths.  It defaults to `/'.
You might, say, use --destdir=/tmp/ntp for a test install to see what
the installation paths look like without running as root or touching
system directories.

NB: --destdir is specified at install time, --prefix is specified
at configure time and saved until install time.


== Qualification testing ==

Details on how to qualify NTPsec if you've never used it before
are at devel/testing.txt.

== Strict compatibility mode ==

There have been a handful of forward-incompatible changes from NTP Classic.
These are unlikely to affect normal operation.  However, there is a configure
operation, --enable-classic-mode, that restores certain legacy behaviors. This
is not recommended, as it makes the code a little bulkier and slower.

Here's what it presently does:

* Reverts logging to the old format that designates clocks with magic
  addresses rather than the driver shortname and unit number.

* Enables declaring generic-driver refclocks with the old magic-address
  syntax (but the new syntax won't work for these, though it will for
  other driver types).

* Reverts the default baudrate of the NMEA driver to 4800 (from 9600).

* Restores the old (non-RFC 3339) format of logfile timestamps.

Other behaviors may be added in future releases.

== Optional Features ==

The waf builder accepts `--enable-FEATURE' options to where FEATURE
indicates an optional part of the package.  Do `waf --help' for a list
of options.

refclocks are enabled with `--refclock=<n1,n2,n3..> or --refclock=all'
`waf configure --list' will print a list of available refclocks.

=== --enable-early-droproot ===

Drop root privileges as early as possible.  This requires the refclock
devices to be owned by the same owner or group that ntpd will be
running under (most likely that group will be named "ntp") so that it
can still open the devices.  This can be accomplished by adding
`GROUP="ntp"` or `OWNER="ntp"` to the udev rules that create the
device symlinks for the refclocks.

== Developer options ==

--enable-debug-gdb::
     Enable GDB debugging symbols.

== Operation Controls ==

The waf builder recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

--help::
     Print a summary of the options to `waf configure', and exit.

--version::
     Print the version of waf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

== Cross-compiling ==

Set up a cross-compile environment for the target architecture.  At minimum
it will need its own binaries for the OpenSSL library.

Configure NTPSec with:

  waf configure --cross-compiler=/path/to/your/cross/cc

There are also --cross-cflags and --cross-ldflags to supply the cross compiler
with appropriate values.

== Statistics ==

If you want to generate the ntpviz graphs regularly, add these lines to
your root crontab:

53 * * * * cd /usr/local/src/NTP/ntpsec/ntpstats; ./ntpviz -p 1 -o day
45 11,23 * * * cd /usr/local/src/NTP/ntpsec/ntpstats; ./ntpviz -p 7 -o week

// end
