= Guidance for package builders =

== Package parts ==

Some useful components for package bulding can be found in the etc/
subdirectory, including init boot time scripts, systemd unit files,
and boilerplate for default ntpd configuration.

== Platforms without Python ==

Many tools (actually, almost everything except the core daemon itself)
have either been moved from C to Python or are in the process of
translation.  This is an important step for improving maintainability
and reducing attack surface.  However, we know that some platforms
cannot support Python or choose not to include it in their core
configuration.

For these platorms, we recommend using freeze or cython to render the
Python to C which can be compiled and packaged as a normal executable.
You will need the Python dev tools and headers installed on the build
host to do this.

The freeze utility is shipped with the Python
distribution. Directions are https://wiki.python.org/moin/Freeze[here]

The cython compiler can also be used for this.  For example, to build
a binary version of ntpviz with cython, you can do something like
this:

------------------------------------------------------------------
cc  -I/usr/include/python2.7 -I/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/python2.7 -c ntpviz.c -o ntpviz.o
cc   ntpviz.o -lpython2.7 -o ntpviz
rm ntpviz.c
------------------------------------------------------------------

Binaries built in this way are normal executables with no run-time
dependency on Python.
