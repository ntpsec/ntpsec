It builds on the following systems.  In general there should be no warnings,
but as of the above date, there is one we can't easily work around.  Some
compilers will complain about
  comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions
  at ntpd/ntp_io.c:4638

We have reports that it builds cleanly on at least:
  Fedora 22 and 23 (i686, x86_64)
  CentOS 5.11 (i386)
  Debian wheezy (amd64)  and jessie (amd64, i686)
  Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS and 15.10 on x86_64
  Raspbian wheezy and jessie on ARM v6 and v7 (Pi and Pi 2)
  Debian wheezy on BeagleBone Black ARM v7

  FreeBSD 9.3 on i386 and 10.1 on amd64
  NetBSD 6.1.5 and 7.0 on x86_64
    (see the comment about libevent in ../INSTALL)


The basic parts of ntpd run on all of the above systems.

There are many options that we haven't yet tested.
