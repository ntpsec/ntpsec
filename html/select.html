<p>The clock select algorithm determines from a set of candidates, which are correct (<em>truechimers</em>) and which are not (<em>falsetickers</em>) according to a set of formal correctness assertions. The principles are based on the observation that the maximum error in determining the offset of a candidate cannot exceed one-half the roundtrip delay to the primary reference clock at the time of measurement. This must be increased by the maximum error that can accumulate since then. In NTP the total, called the <em>synchronization distance</em>, is one-half the roundtrip root delay plus the root dispersion plus minor error contributions not considered here.</p>
<p>Given the measured offset <font face="symbol">q<sub>0</sub></font> and synchronization distance <font face="symbol">l</font>, this defines a <em>correctness  interval</em> [<font face="symbol">q<sub>0</sub></font> - <font face="symbol">l</font>, <font face="symbol">q<sub>0</sub></font> + <font face="symbol">l</font>] of points where the true value of <font face="symbol">q</font> lies somewhere on the interval.  The given problem is to determine from a set of correctness intervals, which represent truechimers and which represent falsetickers. The principles must be given a precise definition. The <em>intersection  interval</em> is the smallest interval containing points from the largest  number of correctness intervals. An algorithm that finds the intersection interval   was devised by Keith Marzullo in his doctoral dissertation. It was first implemented in the  DTSS (Digital Time Synchronization Service) in the VMS operating system for the VAX.</p>
<p> While the NTP algorithm is based on DTSS, it remains to establish which point  represents the best estimate of the offset for each candidate.  The best point is at the midpoint <font face="symbol">q<sub>0</sub></font> of the correctness interval; however, the midpoint might not be within the intersection interval. A candidate with a correctness interval  that contains points in the intersection interval is a truechimer and the best offset estimate  is the midpoint of its correctness interval. A candidate with a correctness interval that contains no points in the intersection interval is a falseticker.</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows  correctness intervals for each of four candidates A, B, C and D. We need to find the maximum number of candidates that contain points in common. The result is the interval labeled  DTSS.  In the figure there are three truechimers  A, B and C, and one falseticker D. In theory, any point in the intersection interval can represent the true time.  The clock is considered correct if the number of truechimers found in this way are greater than half the total number of candidates.</p>
<p>The question remains, which is the best point  to represent the true time of each interval? Fortunately, we already have the maximum likelihood estimate at the midpoint of each correctness interval. But, while the midpoint of candidate C is outside the intersection interval, its correctness interval contains points in common with the intersection interval, so the candidate is a truechimer.</p>

<p> The algorithm operates as shown in Figure 2.. Let <em>m</em> be the number of candidates and <em>f</em> the number of falsetickers, initially zero. Move a pointer from  the leftmost endpoint towards the  rightmost endpoint in Figure 1 and count the number of candidates, stopping when that number reaches <em>m</em> - <em>f</em>; this is the left endpoint of the intersection interval. Then, do the same, but moving from the rightmost endpoint towards the leftmost endpoint; this is the right endpoint of the intersection interval. If the left endpoint is greater than the right endpoint; i.e., the interval appears backwards.   increase <em>f</em> by 1. If <em>f</em> is less than <em>n</em> / 2, try again; otherwise, the algorithm fails and no truechimers could be found..</p>
<p>The clock select algorithm then scans the associations. If the right endpoint of the correctness interval for a candidate is greater than the left endpoint of the intersection interval, or if the left endpoint of the correctness interval is less than the right endpoint of the intersection interval, the candidate is a truechimer; otherwise, it is a falseticker.</p>
<p>In practice, with fast LANs and modern computers, the correctness interval can be quite small, especially when the candidates are multiple reference clocks. In such cases the intersection interval may be empty, due to insignificant differences in the  reference clock offsets. To avoid this, the synchronization distance must be at least the value of <tt>mindist</tt>, with default  1 ms. This value can be changed using the  <tt>mindist</tt> option of the <a href="miscopt.html#tos"><tt>tos</tt></a> command.</p>
