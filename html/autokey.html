<h4 id="intro">Introduction</h4>
<p>This distribution includes support for the  Autokey public key algorithms and protocol specified in RFC-5906 &quot;Network Time Protocol Version 4: Autokey Specification&quot;. This support is available only if the OpenSSL library has been installed and the <tt>--enable-autokey</tt> option   is specified when the distribution is built.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that these provisions are ooptional and that selection of which protocol feature is at the option of the client. If the client does not care about authenticztion, it is free to ignore it, even if some other client of the same server elects to participate in either symmetric key or public key cryptography. In the case of public key cryptography, the client is free within some constraints to chose which public key scheme to use and which of several identity schemes to use. A siotably configured server can support many of these at the same time.</p>
<p> Public key cryptography is generally considered more secure than symmetric key cryptography, since the security is based on private and public values which are generated by each participant and where the private value is never revealed. Autokey uses X.509 public certificates, which can be produced by commercial services, utility programs in the OpenSSL software library and the <a href="keygen.html"><tt>ntp-keygen</tt></a> utility program in the NTP software distribution.</p>
<p> The Autokey Version 2 protocol described on the <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/%7emills/proto.html">Autokey Protocol</a> page verifies packet integrity using  message digest algorithms, such as MD5 or SHA,  and verifies the source using  any of several digital signature schemes, such as RSA or DSA. Optional identity schemes described on the <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ident.html">Autokey Identity Schemes</a> page are based on cryptographic challenge/response exchanges. These schemes provide strong security against  masquerade and most forms of clogging attacks. These schemes are described along with an executive summary, current status, briefing slides and reading list on the <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/autokey.html">Autonomous Authentication</a> page.</p>
<p>Autokey authenticates individual packets using cookies bound to the IP source and destination addresses. The cookies must have the same addresses at both the server and client. For this reason operation with network address translation schemes is not possible. This reflects the intended robust security model where government and corporate NTP servers are operated outside firewall perimeters.</p>
<h4 id="config">Configuration</h4>
<p>Autokey has an intimidating number of configuration options, most of which are not necessary in typical scenarios. However, the  Trusted Certificate (TC) scheme is recommended for  national NTP time services, such as those operated by NIST and USNO. Configuration for TC is very simple. For each server, e.g.  <tt>time.nist.gov,</tt> as root:</p>
<p><tt># cd /usr/local/etc<br>
# ntp-keygen -T</tt></p>
<p>This generates an RSA private/public host key file and a self-signed certificate file for  the RSA digital signature algorithm  with  the MD5 message digest algorithm. Include in the <tt>ntp.conf</tt> configuration file something like</p>
<p><tt># disable kernel<br>
  # server 127.127.18.1	minpoll 12 maxpoll 17 # ACTS modem<br>
# phone atdt913035547785 atddt913034944774<br>
  # crypto<br>
# driftfile /etc/nto.drift.</tt></p>
<p>Note the first three lines  are specific to the ACTS driver and NIST modem telephone  numbers. The second number will be tried if the first times out. Alternatively, any other reference clock can be used, or even another time server.</p>
<p>For each client, e.g. <tt>grundoon.udel.edu,</tt> as root:</p>
<p><tt># cd /usr/local/etc<br>
# ntp-keygen</tt></p>
<p>(There is no -<tt>T</tt> option). Include in the <tt>ntp.conf</tt> configuration file something like</p>
<p><tt># server time.nist.gov iburst autokey<br>
 # crypto<br>
# driftfile /etc/nto.drift.</tt></p>
<p>It is possible to configure clients  of server <tt>grundoon.udel.edu</tt> in the same way with the server line pointing to <tt>grundoon.udel.edu</tt>. Dependent clients  authenticate to <tt>time.nistg.gov</tt> through <tt>grundoon.udel.edu</tt>.</p>
<p>In the above configuration examples, the default Autokey host name is the string  returned by the Unix <tt>gethostbyname()</tt> library routine. This name has nothing to do with the DNS name of the host. The Autokey host name is used as the subject and issuer names on the certificate, as well as the default  password for the host key file. The default Autokey host name can be changed using the <tt>-s</tt> option of the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program. The default password can be changed using the <tt>-p</tt> option of the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program and the <tt>pw</tt> option of the <tt>crypto</tt> command.</p>
<p>In special circumstances the Autokey message digest algorithm can be changed using the <tt>digest</tt> option of the <tt>crypto</tt> command. The  digest algorithm is separate and distinct from the symmetric
key message digest algorithm.   If compliance with FIPS 140-2 is required,
the algorithm must be ether <tt>SHA</tt> or <tt>SHA1</tt>. The Autokey message digest algorithm must be the same for  all participants in the NTP subnet (see next section). The message digest/digital signature scheme can be changed for each server separately using the <tt>-c</tt>  option of the <tt>ntp_keygen</tt> program. This applies only for clients of that server, which select whatever scheme the server specifies.</p>
<p>It is important to note that certificates have a defined lifetime of one year from the time of creation. Sometime toward the end of the liftetime period, it is necessary to create a new certificate at both the server and client. For each server and client as root:</p>
<p><tt># ntp_keygen</tt></p>
<p>The options are copied from the current certificate.</p>
<p>There are two timeouts associated with the Autokey scheme. The <em>key list timeout</em> is set by the <tt>automax</tt> coomand, which  specifies the interval between generating new key lists by the client. The default timeout of about 1.1 hr is appropriate for the majority of configurationas and ordinarily should not be changed. The <em>revoke timeout</em> is set by the <tt>revoke</tt> command, which  specifies the interval between generating new server private values. It is intened to reduce the vulnerability to cryptanalysis; however,  new values  require the server to encrypt each client cookie separately. The default timeout of about 36 hr is appropriate for most  servers, but might be too short for national time servers.</p>
<h4 id="cert">Autokey Subnets</h4>
<p> An Autokey subnet consists of a collection of hosts configured as an acyclic, directed tree with roots one or more trusted hosts (THs) operating at the lowest stratum of the subnet. The THs are synchronized  directly or indirectly to national time services via trusted means, such as radio, satellite or telephone modem, or a  private, dedicated NTP subnet. Autokey hosts operate as servers, clients or both at the same time.</p>
<p>Autokey uses industry standard X.500 digital certificates to verify server authenticity. A certificate includes the subject name of the client, the issuer name of the server, the public key of the server and the time  period over which the the server public and private keys are valid.   All Autokey hosts have  a self-signed certificate with   the  Autokey name as both the subject and issuer. During the protocol, additional certificates are produces with the Autokey host name as subject and the host that signs the certificate as issuer.   A certificate trail is a sequence of certificates, each signed by a host one stratum nearer the THs and terminating at the self-signed certificate of a TH.</p>
<p>The certificate trail authenticates each host on the trail to  the THs, but does not  verify the authenticity of the time values themselves. If the valid periods of both the server and client overlap, both certificates are  considered valid. If  the server period begins later than the client period, the client certificate has expired; if the client period begins later than the server period, the server certificate has expired. However, as an ordinary product of the protocol, each client provides its self-signed certificate to the server next nearer to the THs for signature. In order for the signature to succeed, the certificate valid period  must begin within the valid period  of the server certificate. This requires the client time to be within the server valid period.</p>
<p>The Autokey protocol runs for each association separately. During the protocol the client recursively obtains all the certificates on the trail to a DH, saving each in a cache ordered from most recent to oldest. If an expired certificate is found, it is marked for later replacement when a new certificate is constructed. As the client certificate is not involved in the trail, it can only be declared valid or expired when the server  signs it. </p>
<p>The certificates derived from each association are combined in the cache with duplicates suppressed. If it happens that two different associations contribute certificates to the cache, a certificate on the trail from one association  could expire before any on another trail. In this case the remaining trails  will survive until the expired certificate is replaced. Once saved in the cache, a certificate remains valid until it expires or is replaced by a new one.</p>
<p> It is important to nte that eth certificate trail is confirmed only at startup when an association is mobilized. Once validated in this way, a the server remains valid until it or the client is demobilized, even if  certificates on the trail to the THs expire.</p>
<h4 id="group">NTP Secure Groups</h4>
<p>NTP security groups are and extension of NTP subnets. They include in addition to certificate trails one or another identity schemes described on the  <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ident.html">Autokey Identity Schemes</a>  page. NTP secure groups are used to define cryptographic compartments and security
  hierarchies. The identity scheme insures that the server is authentic and not masqueraded by an intruder acting as a middleman.</p>
<p> As in NTP subnets, the THs are at the lowest stratum of the secure group. For secure group THs the string specified by the <tt>-s</tt> option of the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> progam is the name used as the subject and issuer of the trusted certificate and is also the name of the secure group. This name must match the <tt>ident</tt> option
  of the <tt>crypto</tt> command, which is the group name for all  group hosts and the
  name used in the identity files. The file naming conventions are described on
  the <a href="keygen.html">ntp-keygen</a> page.</p>
<p>The Autokey identity schemes involve a challenge-response exchange where a client generates a nonce and sends to the server. The server performs a mathematical operation involving a second nonce and a secret key, and sends the result along with a hash to the client. The client performs a another mathematical operation and verifies the result with the hash. Since each exchange involves two nonces, even after repeated observations of many exchanges, an intruder cannot learn the secret group key. It is this quality that allows the secre group key to persist long after the longest period of certificate validity. In the Schnorr IFF scheme considered in this section, the secret group key is not divulged to the clients, so they cannot conspire to prove identity to other hosts.</p>
<p>As in NTP subnets, each secure group includes one or more trusted hosts (THs) operating at the  lowest stratum in the group. For THs the  group name specifed by thei -i option of the ntp_keygen program and the ident option of the crypto command is used as the subject and issuer  of the TH self-signed trusted certificate.   For the IFF scheme, the other group hosts need only the crypto command with no options. </p>
<p>As in NTP subnest, NTP secure group hosts are configured as an acyclic tree rooted on the THs. All group hosts construct an  unbroken  certificate trail from each host, possibly via intermediate hosts, and ending at a TH. In addition, each group host verifies the server has the secret key using the idnetity exchange. When a host starts up, it recursively retrieves the certificates along the trail to the TH in order to verify group membership and avoid masquerade and middleman attacks.</p>
<h4 id="cfg">NTP Securfe Group Configuration</h4>
<p> The simplest scenario consists of a TH where the host name of the TH is also the name of the group. For the simplest identity scheme TC, the TH generates host key and trusted certificate files using the <tt>ntp-keygen -T</tt> command, while the remaining group hosts use the same command with no options to generate the host key and public certificate files. All hosts use the <tt>crypto</tt> configuration command with no options. Configuration with passwords is described in the <a href="keygen.html">ntp-keygen</a> page. All group hosts are configured as an acyclic tree with root the TH.</p>
<p>When an identity scheme is included, for example IFF, the TH generates host
  key, trusted certificate and private server identity key files using the <tt>ntp-keygen
  -T -I -i <i>group</i></tt> command, where <tt><i>group</i></tt> is the group
  name. The remaining group hosts use the same command as above. All hosts
  use the <tt>crypto ident group<i></i></tt> configuration command.</p>
<p>Hosts with no dependent clients can retrieve client parameter files from an
  archive or web page. The <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> can export these data using the <tt>-e</tt> option.
  Hosts with dependent clients other than the TH must retrieve copies of the server
  key files using secure means. The <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> can export these data
  using the <tt>-q</tt> option. In either case the data are installed as a file
  and then renamed using the name given as the first line in the file, but without
  the filestamp.</p>
<h4 id="exam">Examples</h4>
<div align="center"> <img src="pic/group.gif" alt="gif"> </div>
<p>Consider a scenario involving three secure groups RED, GREEN and BLUE. RED and BLUE are typical of national laboratories providing certified time to the Internet at large. As shown ion the figure, RED TH mort and BLUE TH macabre run NTP symmetric mode with each other for monitoring or backup. For the purpose of illustration, assume both THs are primary servers. GREEN is typical of a large university providing certified time to the campus community. GREEN TH howland is a broadcast client of both RED and BLUE. BLUE uses the IFF scheme, while both RED and GREEN use the GQ scheme, but with different keys. YELLOW is a client of GREEN and for purposes of illustration a TH for YELLOW.</p>
<p>The BLUE TH macabre uses configuration commands</p>
<p><tt>crypto pw qqsv ident blue</tt><br>
  <tt>peer mort autokey</tt><br>
  <tt>broadcast <i>address</i> autokey</tt></p>
<p>where <tt>qqsv</tt> is the password for macabre files and <i>address</i> is the broadcast address for the local LAN. It generates BLUE files using the commands</p>
<p><tt>ntp-keygen -p qqsv -T -G -i blue</tt><br>
  <tt>ntp-keygen -p qqsv -e &gt;ntpkey_gqpar_blue</tt></p>
<p>The first line generates the host, trusted certificate and private GQ server keys file. The second generates the public GQ client parameters file, which can have any nonconflicting mnemonic name.</p>
<p>The RED TH mort uses configuration commands</p>
<p><tt>crypto pw xxx ident red</tt><br>
  <tt>peer macabre autokey</tt><br>
  <tt>broadcast <i>address</i> autokey</tt></p>
<p>where <tt>xxx</tt> is the password for mort files. It generates RED files using the commands</p>
<p><tt>ntp-keygen -p xxx -T -I -i red</tt><br>
  <tt>ntp-keygen -p xxx -e &gt;ntpkey_iffpar_red</tt></p>
<p> The GREEN TH howland uses configuration commands</p>
<p><tt>crypto pw yyy ident green</tt><br>
  <tt>broadcastclient</tt></p>
<p>where <tt>yyy</tt> is the password for howland files. It generates GREEN files using the commands</p>
<p><tt>ntp-keygen -p yyy -T -G -i green</tt><br>
  <tt>ntp-keygen -p yyy -e &gt;ntpkey_gqpar_green</tt><br>
  <tt>ntp-keygen -p yyy -q zzz &gt;zzz_ntpkey_gqkey_green</tt></p>
<p>The first two lines serve the same purpose as the preceding examples. The
  third line generates a copy of the private GREEN server file for use on another
  server in the same group, say YELLOW, but encrypted with the <tt>zzz</tt> password.</p>
<p>A client of GREEN, for example YELLOW, uses the configuration commands</p>
<p><tt>crypto pw abc ident green</tt><br>
  <tt>server howland autokey</tt></p>
<p>where <tt>abc</tt> is the password for its files. It generates files using the command</p>
<p><tt>ntp-keygen -p abc</tt></p>
<p>The client retrieves the client file for that group from a public archive or web page using nonsecure means. In addition, each server in a group retrieves the private server keys file from the TH of that group, but it is encrypted and so must be sent using secure means. The files are installed in the keys directory with name taken from the first line in the file, but without the filestamp.</p>
<p>Note that if servers of different groups, in this case RED and BLUE, share the same broadcast media, each server must have client files for all groups other than its own, while each client must have client files for all groups. Note also that this scenario is for illustration only and probably would not be wise for practical use, as if one of the TH reference clocks fails, the certificate trail becomes cyclic. In such cases the symmetric path between RED and BLUE, each in a different group, would not be a good idea.</p>
<h4 id="ident2">Identity Schemes and Cryptotypes</h4>
<p>All configurations include a public/private host key pair and matching certificate. Absent an identity scheme, this is a Trusted Certificate (TC) scheme. There are three optional identity schemes, IFF, GQ and MV described on the <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/%7emills/ident.html">Identity Schemes</a> page. With these schemes all servers in the group have encrypted server identity keys, while clients have nonencrypted client identity parameters. The client parameters can be obtained from a trusted agent (TA), usually one of the THs of the lower stratum group. Further information on identity schemes is on the <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ident.html">Autokey Identity Schemes</a> page.</p>
<p>A specific combination of authentication and identity schemes is called a <em>cryptotype</em>, which applies to clients and servers separately. A group can be
  configured using more than one cryptotype combination, although not all combinations
  are interoperable. Note however that some cryptotype combinations may successfully
  intemperate with each other, but may not represent good security practice. The
  server and client cryptotypes are defined by the the following codes.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>NONE</dt>
  <dd>A client or server is type NONE if authentication is not available or not configured. Packets exchanged between client and server have no MAC.</dd>
  <dt>AUTH</dt>
  <dd>A client or server is type AUTH&nbsp;if the <tt>key</tt> option is specified with the <tt>server</tt> configuration command and the client and server keys are compatible. Packets exchanged between clients and servers have a MAC.</dd>
  <dt>PC</dt>
  <dd>A client or server is type PC if the <tt>autokey</tt> option is specified with the <tt>server</tt> configuration command and compatible host key and private certificate files are present. Packets exchanged between clients and servers have a MAC.</dd>
  <dt>TC</dt>
  <dd>A client or server is type TC  if the <tt>autokey</tt> option is specified with the <tt>server</tt> configuration command and compatible host key and public certificate files are present. Packets exchanged between clients and servers have a MAC.</dd>
  <dt>IDENT</dt>
  <dd>A client or server is type IDENT  if the <tt>autokey</tt> option is specified with the <tt>server</tt> configuration command and compatible host key, public certificate and identity scheme files are present. Packets exchanged between clients and servers have a MAC.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The compatible cryptotypes for clients and servers are listed in the following table.</p>

<h4 id="err">Error Codes</h4>
<p>Errors can occur due to mismatched configurations, unexpected protocol restarts, expired certificates and unfriendly people. In most cases the protocol state machine recovers automatically by retransmission, timeout and restart, where necessary. Some errors are due to mismatched keys, digest schemes or identity schemes and must be corrected by installing the correct media and/or correcting the configuration file. One of the most common errors is expired certificates, which must be regenerated and signed at least once per year using the <a href="keygen.html"><tt>ntp-keygen</tt> - generate public and private keys</a> program.</p>
<p>The following error codes are reported via the NTP control and monitoring protocol trap mechanism and to the <tt>cryptostats</tt> monitoring file if configured.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>101 bad field format or length</dt>
  <dd>The packet has invalid version, length or format.</dd>
  <dt>102 bad timestamp</dt>
  <dd>The packet timestamp is the same or older than the most recent received. This could be due to a replay or a server clock time step.</dd>
  <dt>103 bad filestamp</dt>
  <dd>The packet filestamp is the same or older than the most recent received. This could be due to a replay or a key file generation error.</dd>

  <dd>The public key is missing, has incorrect format or is an unsupported type.</dd>
  <dt>105 unsupported digest type</dt>
  <dd>The server requires an unsupported digest/signature scheme.</dd>

<h4 id="file">Files</h4>
<p>See the <a href="keygen.html"><tt>ntp-keygen</tt></a> page. Note that provisions to load leap second values from the NIST files have been removed. These provisions are now available whether or not the OpenSSL library is available. However, the functions that can download these values from servers remains available.</p>
