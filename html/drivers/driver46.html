    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>
      This driver is a client driver to the GPSD daemon, which over
      the time became increasingly popular for UN*Xish platforms. GPSD
      can manage several devices in parallel, aggregate information,
      and acts as a data hub for client applications. GPSD can also
      auto-detect and handle PPS hardware signals on serial
      ports. Have a look at <a href="http://www.catb.org/gpsd/">the
      GPSD project page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>It is imortant to understand that this driver needs a GPS
      device with PPS support to operate.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The GPSD-NG protocol is text based, using JSON notation to
      transfer records in form of JSON objects. The driver uses a
      TCP/IP connection to <tt>localhost:gpsd</tt> to connect to the
      daemon and then requests the GPS device <tt>/dev/gps<i>u</i></tt>
      to be watched. (Different clock units use different devices, and
      GPSD is able to give only the relevant information to a clock
      instance.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This driver does not expect GPSD running or the clock device to
      be present <i>a priori</i>; it will try to re-establish a lost
      or hitherto unsuccessful connection. There is a 10 seconds delay
      between a connection loss or failed attempt and the next
      reconnect attempt; this makes sure that there is no thrashing on
      the network layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The overall accuracy depends on the receiver used. The driver
      uses the error estimations (95% probability limits) provided by
      GPSD to set the clock precision dynamically according to these
      readings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver needs the VERSION, TPV and PPS objects of the GPSD
      protocol. (Others are quietly ignored.)
    </p>


    <h4>Naming a Device</h4>
    <p>
      The GPSD driver uses the same name as the NMEA driver,
      namely <tt>/dev/gps<i>u</i></tt>. There is a simple reason for
      that: While the NMEA driver and the GPSD driver can be active at
      the same time <strong>for different devices</strong>, they
      cannot access the same device at a time. Having the same name
      helps on that. It also eases migration from using NMEA directly
      to using GPSD, as no new links etc need to be created.

      GPSD is normally started with the device name to access; it can
      also be instructed by hotplug scripts to add or remove devices
      from its device pool. Luckily, the symlinks used by the NMEA
      driver are happily accepted and used by GPSD; this makes it
      possible to use the symlink names as device identification.

    <h4>The 'mode' byte</h4>
    <p>
      Until now, GPSD has no mode bits.
