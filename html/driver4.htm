Spectracom 8170 and Netclock/2 WWVB Receivers</H3>

Synopsis</H4>
Address: 127.127.4.<I>u</I>
<BR>Reference ID: <TT>WWVB</TT>
<BR>Driver ID: <TT>WWVB_SPEC</TT>
<BR>Serial Port: <TT>/dev/wwvb<I>u</I></TT>; 9600 baud, 8-bits, no parity
<BR>Features: <TT>tty_clk</TT>
<H4>
Description</H4>
This driver supports the Spectracom Model 8170 and Netclock/2 WWVB Synchronized
Clock. This clock has proven a reliable source of time, except in some
cases of high ambient conductive RF interference. The claimed accuracy
of the clock is 100 usec relative to the broadcast signal; however, in
most cases the actual accuracy is limited by the precision of the timecode
and the latencies of the serial interface and operating system.

<P>The DIPswitches on this clock should be set to 24-hour display, AUTO
DST off, data format 0 or 2 (see below) and baud rate 9600. If this clock
is to used as the source for the IRIG Audio Decoder (refclock_irig.c in
this distribution), set the DIPswitches for AM IRIG output and IRIG format
1 (IRIG B with signature control).

<P>There are two timecode formats used by these clocks. Format 0, which
is available with both the Netclock/2 and 8170, and format 2, which is
available only with the Netclock/2 and specially modified 8170.

<P>Format 0 (22 ASCII printing characters):
<PRE>
&lt;cr>&lt;lf>i  ddd hh:mm:ss  TZ=zz&lt;cr>&lt;lf>

on-time = first &lt;cr>
i = synchronization flag (' ' = in synch, '?' = out synch)
hh:mm:ss = hours, minutes, seconds
</PRE>
The alarm condition is indicated by other than ' ' at <TT>i</TT>, which
occurs during initial synchronization and when received signal is lost
for about ten hours.

<P>Format 2 (24 ASCII printing characters):
<PRE>
&lt;cr>&lt;lf>iqyy ddd hh:mm:ss.fff ld

on-time = &lt;cr>
i = synchronization flag (' ' = in synch, '?' = out synch)
q = quality indicator (' ' = locked, 'A'...'D' = unlocked)
yy = year (as broadcast)
ddd = day of year
hh:mm:ss.fff = hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds
</PRE>
The alarm condition is indicated by other than ' ' at <TT>i</TT>, which
occurs during initial synchronization and when received signal is lost
for about ten hours. The unlock condition is indicated by other than '
' at <TT>q</TT>.

<P>The <TT>q</TT> is normally ' ' when the time error is less than 1 ms
and a character in the set <TT>A...D</TT> when the time error is less than
10, 100, 500 and greater than 500 ms respectively. The <TT>l</TT> is normally
' ', but is set to <TT>L</TT> early in the month of an upcoming UTC leap
second and reset to ' ' on the first day of the following month. The <TT>d</TT>
is set to <TT>S</TT> for standard time <TT>S</TT>, <TT>I</TT> on the day
preceding a switch to daylight time, <TT>D</TT> for daylight time and <TT>O</TT>
on the day preceding a switch to standard time. The start bit of the first
&lt;cr> is synchronized to the indicated time as returned.

<P>This driver does not need to be told which format is in use - it figures
out which one from the length of the message. A three-stage median filter
is used to reduce jitter and provide a dispersion measure. The driver makes
no attempt to correct for the intrinsic jitter of the radio itself, which
is a known problem with the older radios.
<H4>
Monitor Data</H4>
The driver writes each timecode as received to the <TT>clockstats</TT>
file. When enabled by the <TT>flag4</TT> fudge flag, a table of quality
data maintained internally by the Netclock/2 is retrieved and written to
the <TT>clockstats</TT> file when the first timecode message of a new day
is received.
