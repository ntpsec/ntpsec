<h4 id="intro">General Overview</h4>
<p>This page summarizes the criteria for choosing from among a number of potential sources suitable contributors to the clock discipline algorithm. The criteria are very meticulous, since they have to handle many different scenarios that may be optimized for peculiar circumstances, including some scenarios designed to support planetary and deep space missions.</p>
<p>Recall the suite of NTP data acquisition and grooming algorithms as these algorithms proceed in five phases. Phase one discovers the available sources and mobilizes an association for each candidate found. These candidates can result from explicit configuration, broadcast discovery or the pool and manycast autonomous configuration schemes. See the <a href="discover.html">Automatic Server Discovery Schemes</a> page for further information.</p>
<p> Phase two refines the selectable   candidates by  excluding those sources showing one or more of the following errors:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A stratum error occurs if (1) the source had never been synchronized or (2) the stratum of the source is below the <tt>floor</tt> option or not below the <tt>ceiling</tt> option of the <a href="miscopt.html#tos"><tt>tos</tt></a> command. The default value for these options are 0 and 16, respectively.</li>
  <li>A distance error occurs for a remote source if the root distance is not below the distance threshold <tt>maxdist</tt> option of the <a href="miscopt.html#tos"><tt>tos</tt></a> command. The default value for this option is 1.5 s for networks including only the Earth, but this should be increased to 2.5 s for networks including the Moon.</li>
  <li>A loop error occurs if the source is synchronized to the client or if the source is synchronized to the same source as the client.</li>
  <li>An unreachable error occurs if the source is unreachable or if the <tt>server</tt> or <tt>peer</tt> command for the source includes the <tt>noselect</tt> option.</li>
</ol>
<p>Phase three uses the algorithm described on the <a href="select.html">Clock Select Algorithmm</a> page to determine the truechimers from among the selectable candidates, leaving behind the falsetickers. A server or peer configured with the <tt>true</tt> option is declared a truechimer independent of this algorithm. Phase four uses the algorithm described on the <a href="cluster.html">Clock Cluster Algorithm</a> page to cast off statistical outliers from the truechimers until a number of survivors not less than   <tt>minclock</tt> remain. The <tt>minclock</tt> has default 3, but can be changed with the <tt>minclock</tt> option of the <a href="miscopt.html#tos"><tt>tos</tt></a> command.</p>
<p> Phase five uses a set of algorithms and mitigation rules described on this page. The algorithms rank the survivors to produce  combined statistics used to discipline the clock. The mitigation rules select from among the survivors a system peer from which a set of system statistics can be inherited and passed along to  dependent clients, if any.  The algorithms and rules are the main topic of this page. The clock offset developed from these algorithms can discipline the system clock either using the <a href="discipline.html">clock discipline algorithm</a> or enable the kernel to discipline the system clock directly, as described on the <a href="kern.html">A Kernel Model for Precision Timekeeping</a> page. </p>
<h4 id="combine">Combine Algorithm</h4>
<p> The clock combine algorithm uses the survivor list to produce a weighted average of both offset and jitter. Absent other considerations discussed later, the combined offset is used to discipline the system clock, while the combined jitter is augmented with other components to produce the system jitter statistic inherited by dependent clients, if any.</p>
<p> The clock combine algorithm uses a weight factor for each survivor computed as the select threshold minus the synchronization distance. Since the select algorithm rejects candidates with synchronization distance greater than the select threshold, the weight factor is always positive. This design  favors the survivors at the smaller distance, which have the smaller maximum error statistics.</p>
<h4 id="clockhop">Anti-Clockhop Algorithm</h4>
<p>The anti-clockhop algorithm is intended for cases where multiple  servers are available on a fast LAN with modern computers. Typical offset differences between servers in such cases are less than 0.5 ms. However,  changes between servers can result in unnecessary system jitter. The object of the anti-clockhop algorithm is to avoid changing  the server unless it becomes stale or the distance increases substantially over other candidates on the list.</p>
<p>To help compact this discussion, we will call the last selected system peer the <em>old peer</em>, and the peer at the head of the survivor list the <em>candidate peer</em>. The anti-clockhop algorithm is called immediately after the combine algorithm. First, the  survivor list produced by the clock cluster algorithm is  sorted  by increasing synchronization distance. The algorithm then initializes the anti-clockhop threshold with the value of  <tt>mindist</tt>, by default 1 ms. </p>
<p>If there was no old peer or the old and candidate peers are the same,   the candidate peer becomes the system peer. If not, the algorithm measures the difference between the offset of the old peer and the candidate peer. If the difference exceeds the anti-clockhop threshold, the candidate peer becomes the system peer and the anti-clockhop threshold is restored to its original value. If not, the old peer continues as the system peer. However, at each subsequent call, the algorithm reduces the anti-clockhop threshold by half. Should operation continue in this way, the candidate peer will eventually become the system peer.</p>
<h4 id="peer">Peer Classification</h4>
<p>The behavior of the various algorithms and mitigation rules involved depends on how the various synchronization sources are classified. This depends on whether the source is local or remote and if local, the type of source. The following classes are defined:</p>
<ol>
  <li>An association configured for a remote server or peer is classified simply as a <i>server</i>. All other associations are classified as a <i>device driver</i> of one kind or another. In general, one or more sources of either or both types will be configured in each installation.</li>
  <li>If all sources have been lost and one or more hosts on a  common DMZ network have  specified the orphan stratum in the <tt>orphan</tt> option of the <a href="miscopt.html#tos"><tt>tos</tt></a> command, each of them becomes an  <i>orphan parent</i>. Dependent orphan children on the same DMZ network will see the orphan parents as if synchronized to a  server at the orphan stratum.  Note that, as described below,  all the orphan children having the same set of orphan parents will select the same parent.</li>
  <li>When a device driver has been configured for pulse-per-second (PPS) signals and PPS signals are being received, it is designated the <i>PPS driver.</i> Note that the Pulse-per-Second driver (type 22) is often used as a PPS driver, but any driver can be configure as a PPS driver if the hardware facilities are available. The PPS driver provides precision clock discipline only within &plusmn;0.4 s, so it is always associated with another source or sources that provide the seconds numbering function.</li>
  <li>When the Undisciplined Local Clock driver (type 1) is configured, it is designated the <i>local driver</i>. This driver is used either as a backup source (stratum greater than zero) should all sources fail, or as the primary source (stratum zero) in cases where the kernel time is disciplined by some other means of synchronization, such as the NIST <tt>lock clock</tt> scheme, or another synchronization protocol such as the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) or Digital Time Synchronization Service (DTSS).</li>
  <li>When the Automated Computer Time Service driver (type 18) is configured, it is designated the <i>modem driver</i>. This is used either as a backup source, should all other sources fail, or as the  primary source if the <tt>prefer</tt> option is present.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="prefer">The <tt>prefer</tt> Peer</h4>
<p>The mitigation rules are designed to provide an intelligent selection of the system peer from among the selectable sources of different types. When used with the <tt>server</tt> or <tt>peer</tt> commands, the <tt>prefer</tt> option designates one or more sources as preferred over all others. While the rules do not forbid it, it is usually not useful to designate more than one source as preferred; however, if more than one source is so designated, they are used in the order specified in the configuration file. If the first one becomes un selectable, the second one is considered and so forth. This order of priority is also applicable to multiple PPS drivers, multiple modem drivers and even multiple local drivers, although that would not normally be useful.</p>
<p>The cluster algorithm works on the set of truechimers produced by the select algorithm. At each round the  algorithm casts off the survivor least likely to influence the choice of system peer.    If selectable,  the prefer peer is never discarded; on the contrary, its potential removal becomes a termination condition. However, the prefer peer can still be discarded by the select algorithm as a falseticker; otherwise, the prefer peer becomes the system peer.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, the combine algorithm computes a weighted average of the survivor
  offsets to produce the final offset. However, if a prefer
  peer is among the survivors, the combine algorithm is not used. Instead,
  the offset of the prefer peer is used exclusively as the final offset. In the common case involving a radio clock and a flock of remote backup
  servers, and with the radio clock designated a prefer peer, the result is that
  the radio clock disciplines the system clock as long as the radio itself
  remains operational. However, if the radio fails or becomes a falseticker,
  the averaged backup sources continue to discipline the system clock.</p>
<h4 id="miti">Mitigation Rules</h4>
<p>As the select algorithm scans the associations for selectable candidates, the modem driver and local driver are segregated for later, but only if not designated a prefer peer. If so designated, the driver is included among the candidate population. In addition, if orphan parents are found, the parent with the lowest  metric is segregated for later; the others are discarded. For this purpose the metric is defined as the four-octet IPv4 address or the first four octets of the hashed IPv6 address. The resulting candidates, including any prefer peers found, are processed by the select  algorithm to produce a possibly empty set of truechimers.</p>
<p> As previously noted, the cluster algorithm casts out outliers, leaving the survivor list for later processing. The combine algorithm ranks the survivors  by synchronization distance and temporarily designates the first one  as the  system peer.</p>
<p>If one or more truechimers support a pulse-per-second (PPS) signal and the
  PPS signal is operating correctly, it is designated a PPS driver. If more than
  one PPS diver are found, only the first one is used. The PPS driver is not included
  in the combine algorithm and is mitigated separately.</p>
<p>At this point  the following contributors to the system clock discipline may be available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(potential) system peer, if there are survivors;</li>
  <li>orphan parent, if present;</li>
  <li>local driver and zero offset, if present;</li>
  <li>modem driver and modem offset, if present;</li>
  <li>prefer peer and offset, if present;</li>
  <li>PPS driver and offset, if present.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mitigation algorithm proceeds in three steps in turn.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If there are no survivors, the modem driver becomes the only survivor if there is one. If not, the local driver becomes the only survivor if there is one. If not, the orphan parent becomes the only survivor if there is one. If the number of survivors at this point is less than the <tt>minsane</tt> option of the <a href="miscopt.html#tos"><tt>tos</tt></a> command, the algorithm is terminated and the system variables remain unchanged. Note that <tt>minsane</tt> is by default 1, but can be set at any value including 0.</li>
  <li>If the prefer peer is among the survivors, it becomes the system peer and its  offset and jitter are inherited by the corresponding system variables. Otherwise, the combine algorithm computes these variables from the survivor population.</li>
  <li>If there is a PPS driver and the system clock offset at this point is less than 0.4 s, and if there is a prefer peer among the survivors or if the PPS peer is designated as a prefer peer, the PPS driver becomes the system peer and its offset and jitter are inherited by the system variables, thus overriding any variables already computed. Note that a PPS driver is present only if PPS signals are actually being received and enabled by the associated driver.</li>
</ol>
<p>If none of the above is the case, the data are disregarded and the system variables remain as they are.</p>
<h4 id="mins">The <tt>minsane</tt> Option</H4>
<p> The <tt>minsane</tt> option of the <a href="miscopt.html#tos"><tt>tos</tt></a> command, the <tt>prefer</tt> option of the <tt>server</tt> and <tt>peer</tt> commands and the <tt>flag</tt> option of the <tt>fudge</tt> command for a selected  driver can be used with the mitigation rules to provide many useful configurations. The <tt>minsane</tt> option specifies the minimum number of survivors required to synchronize the system clock.  The <tt>prefer</tt> option operates as described in previous sections. The  <tt>flag</tt> option enables the PPS signal for the selected driver.</p>
<p>A common scenario is a GPS driver with a serial timecode and PPS signal. The
  PPS signal is disabled until the system clock has been set by some means, not
  necessarily the GPS driver. If the serial timecode is within 0.4 s of the PPS
  signal, the GPS driver is designated the PPS driver and the PPS signal disciplines
  the system clock. If the serial timecode becomes unreliable, or if the PPS signal is
  disconnected, the GPS driver stops updating the system clock and so eventually
  becomes unreachable and is replaced by other sources.</p>
<p>Whether or not the GPS driver disables the PPS signal when the timecode becomes unreliable is
  at the discretion of the driver. Ordinarily, the PPS signal is disabled in this case; however, when the GPS receiver has a precision holdover oscillator, the driver may elect to continue PPS discipline . In this case, <tt>minsane</tt> can be set to zero so the  PPS signal continues to discipline the system clock.</p>
