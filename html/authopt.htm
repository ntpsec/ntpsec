        <h4>Authentication Support</h4>
        <p>Authentication support allows the NTP client to verify that the server is in fact known and trusted and not an intruder intending accidentally or on purpose to masquerade as that server. The NTPv3 specification RFC-1305 defines a scheme which provides cryptographic authentication of received NTP packets. Originally, this was done using the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm operating in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, commonly called DES-CBC. Subsequently, this was augmented by the RSA Message Digest 5 (MD5) algorithm using a private key, commonly called keyed-MD5. Either algorithm computes a message digest, or one-way hash, which can be used to verify the server has the correct private key and key identifier.</p>
        <p>NTPv4 retains the NTPv3 scheme, properly described as symmetric key cryptography and, in addition, provides a new Autokey scheme based on public key cryptography. Public key cryptography is generally considered more secure than symmetric key cryptography, since the security is based on a private value which is generated by each server and never revealed. With Autokey all key distribution and management functions involve only public values, which considerably simplifies key distribution and storage. Public key management is based on X.509 certificates, which can be provided by commercial services or produced by utility programs in the OpenSSL software library or the NTPv4 distribution.</p>
        <p>Authentication is configured separately for each association using the <tt>key</tt> or <tt>autokey</tt> subcommand on the <tt>peer</tt>, <tt>server</tt>, <tt>broadcast</tt> and <tt>manycastclient</tt> configuration commands as described in the <a href="confopt.htm">Configuration Options</a> page. The authentication options described below specify the suite of keys, select the key for each configured association and manage the configuration operations. In addition, if public key cryptography is enabled, the commands specify the message digest and signature encryption scheme.</p>
        <p>Authentication is always enabled, although ineffective if not configured as described below. If a NTP packet arrives including a message authentication code (MAC), only if it passes all cryptographic checks is it accepted for further processing. The checks require correct key ID, key value and message digest. If the packet has been modified in any way or replayed by an intruder, it will fail one or more of these checks and be discarded. Furthermore, the Autokey scheme requires a preliminary protocol exchange to obtain the server public key, verify its credentials and compute a private session key.</p>
        <p>The <tt>auth</tt> flag controls whether new associations or remote configuration commands require cryptographic authentication. This flag can be set or reset by the <tt>enable</tt> and <tt>disable</tt> commands and also by remote configuration commands sent by a <tt>ntpdc</tt> program running in another machine. If this flag is enabled, which is the default case, new broadcast/manycast client and symmetric passive associations and remote configuration commands must be cryptographically authenticated using either symmetric key or public key schemes. If this flag is disabled, these operations are effective even if not cryptographic authenticated. It should be understood that operating with the <tt>auth</tt> disabled invites a significant vulnerability where a rogue hacker can seriously disrupt system timekeeping. It is important to note that this flag has no purpose other than to allow or disallow a new association in response to new broadcast and symmetric active messages and remote configuration commands and, in particular, the flag has no effect on the authentication process itself.</p>
        <p>An attractive alternative where multicast support is available is manycast mode, in which clients periodically troll for servers as described in the <a href="assoc.htm">Association Management</a> page. Either symmetric key or public key cryptographic authentication can be used in this mode. The principle advantage of manycast mode is that potential servers need not be configured in advance, since the client finds them during regular operation, and the configuration files for all clients can be identical.</p>
        <p>While the algorithms for symmetric key cryptography are included in the NTPv4 distribution, public key cryptography requires the OpenSSL software library to be installed before building the NTP distribution. Directions for doing that are on the <a href="build.htm">Building and Installing the Distribution</a> page.</p>
        <p>The security model and protocol schemes for both symmetric key and public key cryptography are summarized below; further details are in the briefings, papers and reports at the NTP project page linked from <a href="http://www.ntp.org">www.ntp.org</a>.</p>
        <h4>Symmetric Key Cryptography</h4>
        The original RFC-1305 specification allows any one of possibly 65,534 keys, each distinguished by a 32-bit key identifier, to authenticate an association. The servers and clients involved must agree on the key and key identifier to authenticate NTP packets. Keys and related information are specified in a key file, usually called <tt>ntp.keys</tt>, which must be distributed and stored using secure procedures beyond the scope of the NTP protocol itself. Besides the keys used for ordinary NTP associations, additional keys can be used as passwords for the <tt><a href="ntpq.htm">ntpq</a></tt> and <tt><a href="ntpdc.htm">ntpdc</a></tt> utility programs.
        <p>When <tt>ntpd</tt> is first started, it reads the key file specified in the <tt>keys</tt> configuration command and installs the keys in the key cache. However, individual keys must be activated with the <tt>trusted</tt> command before use. This allows, for instance, the installation of possibly several batches of keys and then activating or deactivating each batch remotely using <tt>ntpdc</tt>. This also provides a revocation capability that can be used if a key becomes compromised. The <tt>requestkey</tt> command selects the key used as the password for the <tt>ntpdc</tt> utility, while the <tt>controlkey</tt> command selects the key used as the password for the <tt>ntpq</tt> utility.</p>
        <h4>Public Key Cryptography</h4>
        <p>NTPv4 supports the original NTPv3 symmetric key scheme described in RFC-1305 and in addition the Autokey protocol, which is based on public key cryptography. The Autokey Version 2 protocol verifies packet integrity using MD5 message digests and verifies the source with digital signatures and any of several digest/signature schemes. Optional identification schemes based on cryptographic challenge/response algorithms are also available. Using all of these schemes provides strong security against replay with or without modification, spoofing, masquerade and most forms of clogging attacks.</p>
        <p>The cryptographic means necessary for all Autokey operations provided by the OpenSSL software library. This library is available from <a href="http://www.openssl.org">http://www.openssl.org</a> and can be installed using the procedures outlined in the <a href="build.htm">Building and Installing the Distribution</a> page. Once installed, the configure and build process automatically detects the library and links the interface routines required.</p>
        <p>The Autokey protocol has several modes of operation corresponding to the various NTP modes supported. Most modes use a special cookie which can be computed independently by the client and server, but encrypted in transmission. All modes use in addition a variant of the S-KEY scheme, in which a pseudo-random key list is generated and used in reverse order. These schemes are described along with an executive summary, current status, briefing slides and reading list, on the <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/autokey.htm">Autonomous Authentication</a> page.</p>
        <p>The specific cryptographic environment used by Autokey servers and clients is determined by a set of files and soft links. This includes a required host key file, required certificate file and optional sign key file, leapsecond file and identification scheme files. The digest/signature scheme is specified in the X.509 certificate along with the matching sign key. There are several schemes available in the OpenSSL software library, each identified by a specific string such as <tt>md5WithRSAEncryption</tt>, which stands for the MD5 message digest with RSA encryption scheme. The current NTP distribution supports all the schemes in the OpenSSL library, including those based on RSA and DSA digital signatures. The schemes currently available are described in the <a href="genkeys.htm"><tt>ntp-keygen</tt></a> page.</p>
        <p>The digest/signature scheme and certificate are provided to dependent clients in the Autokey protocol. Different client or peer associations can use different schemes; each of two symmetric peers can use different schemes. Note that the digest/signature scheme is separate and distinct from the NTP message digest used to construct the packet MAC. The only requirement is that the server sign key and signature algorithm must match the public key and verification algorithm specified in the certificate.</p>
        <h4>Autokey Dances</h4>
        <p>The Autokey protocol is somewhat intricate and a detailed explanation of the subprotocols, called dances, is beyond the scope of this page. Detailed information and briefings can be found via the NTP project page at <a href="html://www.ntp.org">www.ntp.org</a>. Briefly, the dances start when a client requests the server name and status word. Next, the client requests the server host certificate used to verify the signature of subsequent data supplied by the server.</p>
        <p>Next comes the identification procedure which confirms the server group membership. There are four schemes to prove identification: one using private certificates (PC), a second using trusted certificates (TC), a third using a modified Schnorr algorithm (IFF aka Identify Friend or Foe) and the fourth using a modified Guillou-Quisquater (GQ) algorithm. The particular scheme and required parameters and certificates are selected during operation of the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> utility.</p>
        <p>The PC scheme uses a private certificate as group key. The certificate is distributed to all other group members by secret means and never revealed outside the group. The TC scheme involves a conventional certificate trail and a sequence of certificates, each signed by an issuer one stratum level lower than the client and terminating on a self signed trusted certificate, as described in RFC-2510.</p>
        <p>The two remaining schemes involve a cryptographically strong challenge-response exchange. Both the IFF and GQ schemes start when the client sends a nonce to the server, which then rolls its own nonce, performs a mathematical operation and sends the results along with a message digest to the client. The client performs a second mathematical operation to produce a digest that must match the one included in the message.</p>
        <p>The next steps retrieve the cryptographic values needed in the particular dance, including the cookie, autokey values and leapsecond table. As a required step in the TC identification scheme, the client presents the server with its certificate and asks that it be signed using the server private key. The server response is saved for future dependent clients to walk the certificate trail.</p>
        <h4>Interoperability</h4>
        <p>A specific combination of authentication scheme (none, symmetric key, public key) and identification scheme (PC, TC, IFF, GQ) is called a cryptotype, although not all combinations are legal. There may be management configurations where the clients, servers and peers may not all support the same cryptotypes. A secure NTPv4 subnet can be configured in several ways while keeping in mind the principles explained in this section. Note however that some cryptotype combinations may successfully interoperate with each other, but may not represent good security practice.</p>
        <p>The cryptotype of an association is determined at the time of mobilization, either at configuration time or some time later when a message of appropriate cryptotype arrives. When mobilized by a <tt>server</tt> or <tt>peer</tt> configuration command and no <tt>key</tt> or <tt>autokey</tt> subcommands are present, the association is not authenticated; if the <tt>key</tt> subcommand is present, the association is authenticated using the symmetric key ID given as argument; if the <tt>autokey</tt> subcommand is present, the association is authenticated using Autokey.</p>
        <p>When multiple identification schemes are supported in the Autokey protocol, the first message exchange determines which one is used. The client request message contains bits corresponding to which schemes it has available. The server response message contains bits corresponding to which schemes it has available. Both server and client match the received bits with their own and select the common scheme judged most secure. For this purpose the order from most secure to least is GC, IFF, TC. Note that PC does not interoperate with any of the rest, since they require the server certificate which a PC server will not reveal.</p>
        <p>Following the principle that time is a public value, a server responds to any client packet that matches its cryptotype capabilities. Thus, a server receiving an unauthenticated packet will respond with an unauthenticated packet, while the same server receiving a packet of a cryptotype it supports will respond with packets of that cryptotype. However, unconfigured broadcast or manycast client associations or symmetric passive associations will not be mobilized unless the server supports a cryptotype compatible with the first packet received. By default, unauthenticated associations will not be mobilized unless overridden in a decidedly dangerous way.</p>
        <p>Some examples may help to reduce confusion. Client Alice has no specific cryptotype selected. Server Bob has both a symmetric key file and minimal Autokey files. Alice's unauthenticated messages arrive at Bob, who replies with unauthenticated messages. Cathy has a copy of Bob's symmetric key file and has selected key ID 4 in messages to Bob. Bob verifies the message with his key ID 4. If it's the same key and the message is verified, Bob sends Cathy a reply authenticated with that key. If verification fails, Bob sends Cathy a thing called a crypto-NAK, which tells her something broke. She can see the evidence using the <tt>ntpq</tt> program.</p>
        <p>Denise has rolled her own host key and certificate. She also uses one of the identification schemes as Bob. She sends the first Autokey message to Bob and they both dance the protocol authentication and identification steps. If all comes out okay, Denise and Bob continue as described above and in the Internet Draft cited earlier.</p>
        <p>It should be clear from the above that Bob can support all the girls at the same time, as long as he has compatible authentication and identification credentials. Now, Bob can act just like the girls in his own choice of servers; he can run multiple configured associations with multiple different servers (or the same server, although that might not be useful). But, wise security policy might preclude some cryptotype combinations; for instance, running an identification scheme with one server and no authentication with another might not be wise.</p>
        <h4>Key Management</h4>
        <p>The cryptographic values used by the Autokey protocol are incorporated as a set of files generated by the <a href="genkeys.htm"><tt>ntp-keygen</tt></a> utility program, including symmetric keys, required host key and public certificate files and optional sign key, identification parameters and leapseconds files. Alternatively, host and sign key files and certificates can be generated by the OpenSSL&nbsp;utilities and certificates can be imported from public certificate authorities. The symmetric keys file is necessary for the <tt>ntpq</tt> and <tt>ntpdc</tt> utility programs. The remaining files are necessary only for the Autokey protocol. The files incorporate cryptographic values generated by the OpenSSL library algorithms and are in printable PEM-encoded ASCII format. Further information about these files and how they are generated and installed is on the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> page.</p>
        <p>Certificates imported from OpenSSL or public certificate authorities have certian limitations. The certificate should be in ASN.1 syntax, X.509 Version 3 format and encoded in PEM, which is the same format used by OpenSSL. The overall length of the certificate encoded in ASN.1 must not exceed 1024 bytes. The subject distinguished name field (<tt>CN</tt>) is the fully qualified name of the host on which it is used; the remaining subject fields are ignored. The certificate extension fields must not contain either a subject key identifier or a issuer key identifier field; however, an extended key usage field must be included with value <tt>trustRoot</tt>;. Other extension fields are ignored.</p>
        <h4>Random Seed File</h4>
        <p>All cryptographically sound key generation schemes must have means to randomize the entropy seed used to initialize the internal pseudo-random number generator used by the library routines. It is important to understand that entropy must be evolved for each generation, for otherwise the random number sequence would be predictable. Various means dependent on external events, such as keystroke intervals, can be used to do this and some systems have built-in entropy sources. Suitable means are described in the OpenSSL software documentation, but are outside the scope of this page.</p>
        <p>The entropy seed used by the OpenSSL library is contained in a file, usually called <tt>.rnd</tt>, which must be available when starting the NTP daemon or the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program. The NTP daemon will first look for the file using the path specified by the <tt>randfile</tt> subcommand of the <tt>crypto</tt> command. If not specified in this way, or when starting the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program, the OpenSSL library will look for the file using the path specified by the <tt>RANDFILE</tt> environment variable in the user home directory, whether root or some other user. If the <tt>RANDFILE</tt> environment variable is not present, the library will look for the <tt>.rnd</tt> file in the user home directory. If the file is not available or cannot be written, the daemon exits with a message to the system log and the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program exits with a suitable error message.</p>
        <p>The daemon will occasionally add additional entropy and write to the file when generating new keys and certificates, for example, so the file must be writable by root. If the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program is run by other than root, or if the Unix <tt>su</tt> command is used to assume root, the home directory assumed by the OpenSSL library might not be root. Probably the safest way to generate keys is to log in as root, change to the keys directory and run the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program from there</p>

Note that the size of the key list for each association depends on this interval and the current poll interval. The default value is 12 (4096 s or about 1.1 hours). For poll intervals above the specified interval, a session key list with a single entry will be regenerated for every message sent.
            <dt><tt>controlkey <i>key</i></tt>
            <dd>Specifies the key identifier to use with the <a href="ntpq.htm"><tt>ntpq</tt></a> utility, which uses the standard protocol defined in RFC-1305. The <tt><i>key</i></tt> argument is the key identifier for a trusted key, where the value can be in the range 1 to 65,534, inclusive.

                <dd>Specifies the location of the optional GQ parameters file. This overrides the link <tt>ntpkey_gqpar_<i>hostname</i></tt> in the keys directory.
                <dt><tt>host <i>file</i></tt>
                <dd>Specifies the location of the required host key file. This overrides the link <tt>ntpkey_key_<i>hostname</i></tt> in the keys directory.
                <dt><tt>iff <i>file</i></tt>
                <dd>Specifies the location of the optional IFF parameters file.This overrides the link <tt>ntpkey_iff_<i>hostname</i></tt> in the keys directory.
                <dt><tt>leap <i>file</i></tt>
                <dd>Specifies the location of the optional leapsecond file. This overrides the link <tt>ntpkey_leap</tt> in the keys directory.
                <dt><tt>pw <i>password</i></tt>
                <dd>Specifies the password to decrypt files containing private keys and identity parameters. This is required only if these files have been encrypted.
                <dt><tt>randfile <i>file</i></tt>

            <dt><tt>keys <i>keyfile</i></tt>
            <dd>Specifies the location of the MD5 key file containing the keys and key identifiers used by <tt>ntpd</tt>, <tt>ntpq</tt> and <tt>ntpdc</tt> when operating with symmetric key cryptography.
            <dt><tt>keysdir <i>path</i></tt>
            <dd>This command specifies the default directory path for cryptographic keys, parameters and certificates.. The default is <tt>/usr/local/etc/</tt>.

            <dd>Specifies the key identifier to use with the <a href="ntpdc.htm"><tt>ntpdc</tt></a> utility program, which uses a proprietary protocol specific to this implementation of <tt>ntpd</tt>. The <tt><i>key</i></tt> argument is a key identifier for the trusted key, where the value can be in the range 1 to 65,534, inclusive.
            <dt><tt>revoke [<i>logsec</i>]</tt>
            <dd>Specifies the interval between re-randomization of certain cryptographic values used by the Autokey scheme, as a power of 2 in seconds. These values need to be updated frequently in order to deflect brute-force attacks on the algorithms of the scheme; however, updating some values is a relatively expensive operation. The default interval is 16 (65,536 s or about 18 hours). For poll intervals above the specified interval, the values will be updated for every message sent.
            <dt><tt>trustedkey <i>key</i> [...]</tt>
            <dd>Specifies the key identifiers which are trusted for the purposes of authenticating peers with symmetric key cryptography, as well as keys used by the <tt>ntpq</tt> and <tt>ntpdc</tt> programs. The authentication procedures require that both the local and remote servers share the same key and key identifier for this purpose, although different keys can be used with different servers. The <tt><i>key</i></tt> arguments are 32-bit unsigned integers with values from 1 to 65,534.
        </dl>
