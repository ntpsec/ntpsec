<h4 id="descrip">Description</h4>

<p>This program generates cryptographic data files used by the NTPv4 authentication
	and identity schemes. It generates MD5 keys used in symmetric key cryptography
	and, if the OpenSSL software library has been installed, it generates host keys,
	certificates and identity keys used in the Autokey public key cryptography.
	The symmetric keys file is generated in a format comparable with NTPv3 and also
	used with NTPv4. All other files are in PEM-encoded printable ASCII format so
	they can be embedded as MIME attachments in mail to other sites and certificate
	authorities.</p>

<p>When used to generate symmetric keys, the program produces a file containing
	16 random keys. If this is the only need, run <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> with the <tt>-M</tt> option
	and disregard the remainder of this page. The file can be edited later with
	purpose-chosen passwords. Each line of the file contains three fields, first
	an integer between 1 and 65534, inclusive, representing the key identifier used
	in the <tt>server</tt> and <tt>peer</tt> configuration command. Next is the
	single character <tt>M</tt> to designate the key as MD5. Finally is the key
	itself from 1 to 31 characters chosen from the printable ASCII set with the
	exclusion of space and #. As is custom, # and the remaining characters on the
	line are ignored.</p>

<p>Generated files are compatible with other OpenSSL applications and other Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) resources. Certificates generated by this program should be compatible with extant industry practice, although some users might find the interpretation of X509v3 extension fields somewhat liberal. However, the identity keys are probably not compatible with anything other than Autokey.</p>

<p>Most files used by this program are encrypted using a private password. The <tt>-p</tt> option specifies the password for local files and the <tt>-q</tt> option the password for files to be sent to remote sites. If no local password is specified, the host name returned by the Unix <tt>gethostname()</tt> function is used. If no remote password is specified, the local password is used.</p>

<p>The <tt>pw</tt> option of the <tt>crypto</tt> configuration command specifies the read password for previously encrypted files. This must match the local password used by this program. If not specified, the host name is used. Thus, if files are generated by this program without password, they can be read back by <tt>ntpd</tt> without password, but only on the same host.</p>

<p>All files and links are installed by default in the keys directory <tt>/usr/local/etc</tt>, which is normally in a shared filesystem in NFS-mounted networks and cannot be changed by clients. The location of the keys directory can be changed by the <tt>keysdir</tt> configuration command in such cases. Normally, encrypted  files for each host are generated by that host and used only by that host, although exceptions exist as noted later on this page.</p>

<p>This program directs commentary and error messages to the standard error stream <tt>stderr</tt> and
	remote files to the standard output stream <tt>stdout</tt> where they can be
	piped to other applications or redirected to a file. The names used for generated
	files and links all begin with the string <tt>ntpkey</tt> and include the file
	type, generating host and filestamp, as described in the <a href="#fmt">Cryptographic
	Data Files</a> section below</p>

<h4 id="run">Running the Program</h4>

<p>To test and gain experience with Autokey concepts, log in as root and change to the keys directory, usually <tt>/usr/local/etc</tt>. When run for the first time, or if all files with names beginning <tt>ntpkey</tt> have been removed, use the <tt>ntp-keygen </tt>command without arguments to generate a default RSA host key and matching RSA-MD5 certificate with expiration date one year hence. If run again, the program uses the existing keys and parameters and generates a new certificate with new expiration date one year hence; however, the certificate is not generated if the <tt>-e</tt> or <tt>-q</tt> options are  present.</p>

<p>Run the command on as many hosts as necessary. Designate one of them as the
	trusted host (TH) using <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> with the <tt>-T</tt> option and
	configure it to synchronize from reliable Internet servers. Then configure the
	other hosts to synchronize to the TH directly or indirectly. A certificate trail
	is created when Autokey asks the immediately ascendant host towards the root
	to sign its certificate, which is then provided to the immediately descendant
	host on request. All group hosts should have acyclic certificate trails ending
	on the TH.</p>

<p>The host key is used to encrypt the cookie when required and so must be RSA type. By default, the host key is also the sign key used to encrypt signatures. A different sign key can be assigned using the <tt>-S</tt> option and this can be either RSA or DSA type. By default, the signature message digest type is MD5, but any combination of sign key type and sign digest type supported by the OpenSSL library can be specified using the <tt>-c</tt> option. At the moment, legacy considerations require the NTP packet header digest type to be MD5.</p>

<h4 id="trust">Trusted Hosts and Secure Groups</h4>

<p>As described on the <a href="authopt.html">Authentication Options</a> page,
	an NTP&nbsp;secure group consists of one or more low-stratum The as the root
	from which all other group hosts derive synchronization directly or indirectly.
	For authentication purposes all hosts in a group must have the same group name
	specified by the <tt>-i</tt> option and matching the <tt>ident</tt> option of
	the <tt>crypto</tt> configuration command. The group name is used in the subject
	and issuer fields of trusted certificates and when constructing the file names
	for identity keys. All hosts must have different host names specified by the <tt>-s</tt> option
	and matching the <tt>host</tt> option of the <tt>crypto</tt> configuration command.
	Host names are used in the subject and issuer fields of nontrusted certificates
	and when constructing the file names for host and sign keys and certificates.
	Host and group names are used only for authentication purposes and have nothing
	to do with NS names.</p>

<h4 id="ident">Identity Schemes</h4>

<p>As described on the <a href="authopt.html">Authentication Options</a> page, there are five identity schemes, three of which - IFF, GQ and MV - require identity keys specific to each scheme. There are two types of files for each scheme, an encrypted keys file and a nonencrypted parameters file, which usually contains a subset of the keys file. In general, NTP secondary servers operating as certificate signing authorities (CSA) use the keys file and clients use the parameters file. Both files are generated by the TA operating as a certificate authority (CA) on behalf of all servers and clients in the group.</p>

<p>The parameters files are public; they can be stored in a public place and sent in the clear. The keys files are encrypted with the local password. To retrieve the keys file, a host sends a mail request to the TA including its local password. The TA encrypts the keys file with this password and returns it as an attachment. The attachment is then copied intact to the keys directory with name given in the first line of the file, but all in lower case and with the filestamp deleted..</p>

<p>For example, the TA can generate IFF keys and trusted certificate using the command</p>

<p><tt>ntp-keygen -p <i>local_passwd</i> -T -I</tt></p>

<p>Once these media have been generated, the TA can then generate the public parameters using the command</p>

<p><tt>ntp-keygen -p local_passwd -e &gt;<i>parameters_file</i></tt></p>

<p>where the <tt>-e</tt> option redirects the unencrypted parameters to the standard output stream for a mail application or stored locally for later distribution. In a similar fashion the <tt>-q</tt> option redirects the encrypted server keys to the standard output stream.</p>

<h4 id="cmd">Command Line Options</h4>

<dl>

<dt><tt>-c [ RSA-MD2 | RSA-MD5 | RSA-SHA | RSA-SHA1 | RSA-MDC2 | RSA-RIPEMD160 | DSA-SHA | DSA-SHA1 ]</tt></dt>
<dd>Select certificate and message digest/signature encryption scheme. Note that RSA schemes must be used with a RSA sign key and DSA schemes must be used with a DSA sign key. The default without this option is <tt>RSA-MD5</tt>.</dd>

<dt><tt>-d</tt></dt>
<dd>Enable debugging. This option displays the cryptographic data produced for eye-friendly billboards.</dd>

<dt><tt>-e</tt></dt>
<dd>Extract the  IFF or GQ public parameters from the <tt>IFFkey</tt> or <tt>GQkey</tt> keys file previously specified. Send the unencrypted data to the standard output stream <tt>stdout</tt>. While the IFF parameters do not reveal the private group key, &nbsp;the GQ parameters  should be used with caution, as they include the group key. Use the <tt>-q</tt> option with password instead. Note: a new certificate is not generated when this option is present. This allows multiple commands with this option but  without disturbing existing media.</dd>

<dt><tt>-G</tt></dt>
<dd>Generate GQ key file <tt>GQkey and</tt> link <tt>gqkey </tt>for the Guillou-Quisquater
	(GQ) identity scheme.</dd>

<dt><tt>-H</tt></dt>
<dd>Generate a new public/private host keys <tt>RSAkey</tt>, and link <tt>host</tt>.</dd>

<dt><tt>-i <i>group</i></tt></dt>
<dd>Set the group name to <tt><i>group</i></tt>. This is used in the identity file names. It must match the group name specified in the <tt>ident</tt> option of the <tt>crypto</tt> configuration command.</dd>

<dt><tt>-I</tt></dt>
<dd>Generate a new encrypted IFF key file <tt>IFFkey </tt>and link <tt>iffkey </tt>for the Schnorr (IFF) identity scheme.</dd>

<dt><tt>-m <i>modulus</i></tt></dt>
<dd>Set the modulus for generating files to <i>modulus</i> bits. The modulus defaults to 512, but can be set from this value to 2048.</dd>

<dt><tt>-M</tt></dt>
<dd>Generate a new MD5 key file.</dd>

<dt><tt>-P</tt></dt>
<dd>Generate a new private certificate used by the PC identity scheme. By default, the program generates public certificates. Note: the PC identity scheme is not recommended for new installations.</dd>

<dt><tt>-p <i>passwd</i></tt></dt>
<dd>Set the password for reading and writing encrypted files to <tt><i>passwd</i></tt>. By default, the password is the host name.</dd>

<dt><tt>-q <i>passwd</i></tt></dt>
<dd>Extract the encrypted IFF or GQ server keys from the <tt>IFFkey</tt> or <tt>GQkey</tt> key file previously generated. The data are sent to the standard output stream <tt>stdout</tt>. Set the password for writing the data, which is also the password to read the data file in another host. By default, the password is the host name. Note: a new certificate is not generated when this option is present. This allows multiple commands with this option but without disturbing existing media.</dd>

<dt><tt>-S [ RSA | DSA ]</tt></dt>
<dd>Generate a new sign key of the designated type. By default, the sign key is the host key.</dd>

<dt><tt>-s <i>host</i></tt></dt>
<dd>Set the host name to <tt><i>host</i></tt>. This is used in the host and sign key file names. It must match the host name specified in the <tt>host</tt> option of the <tt>crypto</tt> configuration command.</dd>

<dt><tt>-T</tt></dt>
<dd>Generate a trusted certificate. By default, the program generates nontrusted certificates.</dd>

<dt><tt>-V <i>nkeys</i></tt></dt>
<dd>Generate server parameters <tt>MV</tt> and <tt><i>nkeys</i></tt> client keys for the Mu-Varadharajan (MV)  identity scheme. Note: support for this option should be considered a work in progress.</dd>

</dl>

<h4 id="rand">Random Seed File</h4>

<p>All cryptographically sound key generation schemes must have means to randomize the entropy seed used to initialize the internal pseudo-random number generator used by the OpenSSL library routines. If a site supports <tt>ssh</tt>, it is very likely that means to do this are already available. The entropy seed used by the OpenSSL library is contained in a file, usually called <tt>.rnd</tt>, which must be available when starting the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program or <tt>ntpd</tt> daemon.</p>

<p>The OpenSSL library looks for the file using the path specified by the <tt>RANDFILE</tt> environment variable in the user home directory, whether root or some other user. If the <tt>RANDFILE</tt> environment variable is not present, the library looks for the <tt>.rnd</tt> file in the user home directory. Since both the <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program and <tt>ntpd</tt> daemon must run as root, the logical place to put this file is in <tt>/.rnd</tt> or <tt>/root/.rnd</tt>. If the file is not available or cannot be written, the program exits with a message to the system log.</p>

<h4 id="priv">Cryptographic Data Files</h4>

<p>File and link names are in the form <tt>ntpkey_<i>key</i>_<i>name</i>.<i>fstamp</i></tt>, where <tt><i>key</i></tt> is the key or parameter type, <tt><i>name</i></tt> is the host or group name and <tt><i>fstamp</i></tt> is the filestamp (NTP&nbsp;seconds) when the file was created). By convention, key fields in generated file names include both upper and lower case alphanumeric characters, while key fields in generated link names include only lower case characters. The filestamp is not used in generated link names.</p>

<p>The key type is a string defining the cryptographic function. Key types include public/private keys <tt>host </tt>and <tt>sign</tt>, certificate <tt>cert</tt> and several challenge/response key types. By convention, files used for challenges have a <tt>par</tt> subtype, as in the IFF&nbsp;challenge <tt>IFFpar</tt>, while files for responses have a <tt>key</tt> subtype, as in the GQ response <tt>GQkey</tt>.</p>

<p>All files begin with two nonencrypted lines. The first line contains the file
	name in the format <tt>ntpkey_<i>key</i>_<i>host</i>.<i>fstamp</i></tt>. The
	second line contains the datestamp in conventional Unix <tt>date</tt> format.
	Lines beginning with <tt>#</tt> are ignored.</p>

<p>The remainder of the file contains cryptographic data encoded first using ASN.1 rules, then encrypted using the DES-CBC algorithm and given password and finally written in PEM-encoded printable ASCII text preceded and followed by MIME content identifier lines.</p>

<p id="symkey">The format of the symmetric keys file is somewhat different than the other files in the interest of backward compatibility. Since DES-CBC is deprecated in NTPv4, the only key format of interest is MD5 alphanumeric strings. Following the header the keys are entered one per line in the format</p>

<p><i><tt>keyno type key</tt></i></p>

<p>where <i><tt>keyno</tt></i> is a positive integer in the range 1-65,535, <i><tt>type</tt></i> is the string <tt>MD5</tt> defining the key format and <i><tt>key</tt></i> is the key itself, which is a printable ASCII string 16 characters or less in length. Each character is chosen from the 93 printable characters in the range 0x21 through 0x7f excluding space and the '#' character.</p>

<p>Note that the keys used by the <tt>ntpq</tt> and <tt>ntpdc</tt> programs are checked against passwords requested by the programs and entered by hand, so it is generally appropriate to specify these keys in human readable ASCII format.</p>

<p>The <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> program generates a MD5 symmetric keys file <tt>ntpkey_MD5key_<i>hostname.filestamp</i></tt>. Since the file contains private shared keys, it should be visible only to root and distributed by secure means to other subnet hosts. The NTP daemon loads the file <tt>ntp.keys</tt>, so <tt>ntp-keygen</tt> installs a soft link from this name to the generated file. Subsequently, similar soft links must be installed by manual or automated means on the other subnet hosts. While this file is not used with the Autokey Version 2 protocol, it is needed to authenticate some remote configuration commands used by the <a href="ntpdc.html"><tt>ntpq</tt></a> and <a href="ntpq.html"><tt>ntpdc</tt></a> utilities.</p>

<h4 id="bug">Bugs</h4>

<p>It can take quite a while to generate some cryptographic values, from one to several minutes with modern architectures such as UltraSPARC and up to tens of minutes to an hour with older architectures such as SPARC IPC.</p>
