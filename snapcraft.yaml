summary: a secure, hardened, and improved implementation of Network Time Protocol
description: |
        NTPsec, as its name implies, is a more secure NTP. Our goal is to
        deliver code that can be used with confidence in deployments with the
        most stringent security, availability, and assurance requirements.
        Towards that end we apply best practices and state-of-the art
        technology in code auditing, verification, and testing. We begin with
        the most important best practice: true open-source code review.
        The NTPsec code is available in a public git repository. One of our
        goals is to support broader community participation.
confinement: devmode

# TODO
# - fixup isolation to get it running in strict mode
#   - extra devices will need new interfaces (e.g. /dev/pps)
#   - leverage upstream ntp apparmor profile to stack on top of snappy isolation
#   - leverage seccomp in ntp to be guarded on the snap level as well
