configuration file listed in the \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP section, below.
.TP
.BR \-< " \fIrcfile\fP," " \-\-load-opts" "=\fIrcfile\fP," " \-\-no-load-opts"

The \fIno-load-opts\fP form will disable the loading
of earlier RC/INI files.  \fI\-\-no-load-opts\fP is handled early,

version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will
print the full copyright notice.
.SH "OPTION PRESETS"
Any option that is not marked as \fInot presettable\fP may be preset
by loading values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s) and values from
environment variables named:
.nf
  \fBNTPSNMPD_<option-name>\fP or \fBNTPSNMPD\fP
.fi
.ad
The environmental presets take precedence (are processed later than)
the configuration files.
The \fIhomerc\fP files are "\fI$HOME\fP", and "\fI.\fP".
If any of these are directories, then the file \fI.ntprc\fP
is searched for within those directories.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
See \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP for configuration environment variables.
.SH "FILES"
See \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP for configuration files.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
One of the following exit values will be returned:
.TP
.BR 0
Successful program execution.
