== SYNOPSIS ==

ntpsnmpd [-n] [-p] [-x transport:socket] 

== DESCRIPTION ==

`ntpsnmpd` is an SNMP MIB agent designed to interface with ntpd.

== OPTIONS ==

`-n`, `--nofork`::
  Do not fork.
`-p`, `--syslog`::
  Log to syslog().
`--agentxsocket`=string::
  The socket address ntpsnmpd uses to connect to net-snmpd. The default
  string for this option is:
+
_______________________
unix:/var/agentx/master
_______________________
+
[<transport-specifier>:]<transport-address> The default "agent X
socket" is the Unix Domain socket _unix:/var/agentx/master_. Another
common alternative is _tcp:localhost:705_.

== USAGE ==

`ntpsnmpd` currently uses a private MIB OID, 'enterprises.5597',
which is the Meinberg top level OEM OID, and '99' is the temporary
working space for this project. The final OID has to be registered with
IANA and this is done by the RFC Editor when the NTPv4 MIB RFC is
standardized.

If you have snmpwalk1 installed you can run

-------------------------------------------------------
% snmpwalk -v2c -c public localhost enterprises.5597.99
-------------------------------------------------------

to see a list of all currently supported NTP MIB objects and their
current values.

== EXIT STATUS ==

One of the following exit values will be returned:

0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)::
  Successful program execution.
1 (EXIT_FAILURE)::
  The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
