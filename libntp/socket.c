/*
 * on Unix systems the stdio library typically
 * makes use of file descriptors in the lower
 * integer range.  stdio usually will make use
 * of the file descriptors in the range of
 * [0..FOPEN_MAX]
 * in order to keep this range clean, for socket
 * file descriptors we attempt to move them above
 * FOPEN_MAX. This is not as easy as it sounds as
 * FOPEN_MAX changes from implementation to implementation
 * and may exceed the current file descriptor limits.
 * We are using following strategy:
 * - keep a current socket fd boundary initialized with
 *   max(0, min(sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX) - FD_CHUNK, FOPEN_MAX))
 * - attempt to move the descriptor to the boundary or
 *   above.
 *   - if that fails and boundary > 0 set boundary
 *     to min(0, socket_fd_boundary - FD_CHUNK)
 *     -> retry
 *     if failure and boundary == 0 return old fd
 *   - on success close old fd return new fd
 *
 * effects:
 *   - fds will be moved above the socket fd boundary
 *     if at all possible.
 *   - the socket boundary will be reduced until
 *     allocation is possible or 0 is reached - at this
 *     point the algrithm will be disabled
