== NAME ==
ntp-wait - Wait for ntpd to stabilize the system clock

== SYNOPSIS ==
ntp-wait [-v] [-n 'number'] [-s 'secs']

== DESCRIPTION ==

`ntp-wait` will send at most _num-tries_ queries to _ntpd_(8)_, sleeping
forsecs-between-triesafter each status return that says ntpd_(8)_has not
yet produced a synchronized and stable system clock._

`ntp-wait` will do this quietly, unless the `-v` flag is provided. This
can be useful at boot time, to delay the boot sequence until after
_ntpd_ `-g` has set the time.

== OPTIONS ==

`-n` number, `--tries`=_number_::
  Number of times to check ntpd. This option takes an integer number as
  its argument. The default _number_ for this option is: 100.
+
The maximum number of times we will check _ntpd_ to see if it has been
able to synchronize and stabilize the system clock.

`-s` secs-between-tries, `--sleep`=_secs-between-tries_::
  How long to sleep between tries. This option takes an integer number
  as its argument. The default _secs-between-tries_ for this option
  is: 6.
+
We will sleep for _secs-between-tries_ after each query of _ntpd_ that
returns "the time is not yet stable".

`-v`, `--verbose`::
  Be verbose.
+
By default, `ntp-wait` is silent. With this option, `ntp-wait` will
provide status information.

== EXIT STATUS ==

One of the following exit values will be returned:

0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)::
  Successful program execution.
1 (EXIT_FAILURE)::
  The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
