* msyslog doesn't have its own mutex.  Non-atomicity can cause scrambled
  logs in some cases involving asynchronous getaddrinfo lookups.

* There is a concurrency bug in asynchronous getaddrinfo lookups which
  nanifests as name lookups getting dropped (thee workaround is to
  specify servers as IP addresses).  Hal says:

The bug is also in NTP classic.

It's allocating a slot for the [DNS] response.  It's screwing up in
the need-more case.

First an overview:

There is one thread doing DNS lookups.  All its info is in a
blocking_child struct.

There are 2 arrays.  One for requests and another for responses.  They
are used as ring buffers.

If the next slot isn't free, ensure_workresp_empty_slot (re)allocates more space
But it doesn't leave the index pointing to a new slot.

I don't think there is any simple fix.  You can't make ring-buffers
bigger by just adding more space on the end.  The fingers may be
pointing into the middle of the block.

There is probably a similar bug on the request side.
