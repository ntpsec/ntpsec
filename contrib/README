The following tools are not production-ready. They are included only as
conveniences, examples or rudimentary starting points for other development
efforts.

cpu-temp-log is a tool to use the output of 'sensors -u' and write the
motherboard temperatures to stdout.  Useful to create a log that can be used
by 'ntpviz --local-temps'

gps-log is a tool to log gpsd data and write the data to stdout.  Useful
to create a log that can be used by 'ntpviz --local-gps'

smartctl-temp-log for hard drives.  It is a tool to read a hard drive's
SMART data to get the disk temperature and write the temperature
to stdout.  Useful to create a log that can be used by 'ntpviz
--local-temps'

temper-temp-log for TEMPer USB thermometer.  Useful for logging room
temperature.  This reads the thermometer using the temper-python command
line utility and writes the temperatures to stdout.  Useful to create a
log that can be used by 'ntpviz --local-temps'

zone-temp-log reads /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*/temp to find the CPU
temperature.  Writes all temperatures found to stdout on one line, preceded by
the unix UTC time in seconds.  This is useful on the Raspberry Pi, among many
other systems.
