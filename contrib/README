The following tools are not production-ready. They are included only as
conveniences, examples or rudimentary starting points for other development
efforts.

ntpconfigtest: Check your linux configuration for the proper entries.

ntpheat is a program to exercise a CPU until the CPU reachs a certain
temperature.  The idea is to get the temperature around the system
oscillator to be near the zero TC point.  Tested on RasPi wrapped
in bubble wrap.  Formerly known as makeheat.

ntpheatusb is a program to control an external USB relay to maintain
a stable temperature.  See the blog post "More Heat" for details:
    https://blog.ntpsec.org/2017/03/21/More_Heat.html

The next 4 tools cpu-temp-log, smartctl-temp-log, temper-temp-log and
zone-temp-log have been replaced by ntplogtemp.  Those programs will stay
 in contrib for a while to give users a chance to migrate.

cpu-temp-log is a tool to use the output of 'sensors -u' and write the
motherboard temperatures to stdout.  Useful to create a log that can be used
by 'ntpviz --local-temps'

smartctl-temp-log for hard drives.  It is a tool to read a hard drive's
SMART data to get the disk temperature and write the temperature
to stdout.  Useful to create a log that can be used by 'ntpviz
--local-temps'

temper-temp-log for TEMPer USB thermometer.  Useful for logging room
temperature.  This reads the thermometer using the temper-python command
line utility and writes the temperatures to stdout.  Useful to create a
log that can be used by 'ntpviz --local-temps'

zone-temp-log reads /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*/temp to find the CPU
temperature.  Writes all temperatures found to stdout on one line, preceded by
the Unix UTC time in seconds.  This is useful on any Linux system that
supports the /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*/temp interface.
