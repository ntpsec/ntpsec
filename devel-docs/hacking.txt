= How-to for NTPsec hackers =

Annoying but necessary legalese:

    By submitting patches to this project, you agree to allow them to be
    redistributed under the project's license according to the normal
    forms and usages of the open-source community.

The code history has been moved to git; the BitKeeper-based advice that used
to live here is obsolete.  As we develop a git-based patch workflow it will be
documented here.

== General notes ==

=== Build system ===

The build uses waf, replacing a huge ancient autoconf hairball that
caused many problems. The waf script is embedded in the top level of
the distribution; run "./waf --help" or consult INSTALL for basic
instructions.

Full waf documentation is at: https://waf.io/

=== C API standards ===

The baseline C standard to write to is ISO/IEC 9899:1999, also known
as C99 (but see the following section on banned functions).  Note that
C99 is a coding standard, not an ABI standard, so it can happily
coexist with distributions that use C89 conventions.

You can download the C99 standard for free from here:
    http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/projekty/vrr/doc/c99.pdf

Only POSIX-1.2001/SuSv3 library functions should be used.  If a library
function not in POSIX 2001 is required, then a wrapper function for back
compatibility must be provided.  One notable case is clock_gettime()
which is used, when available, for increased accuracy, and has a
fallback implementation using native time calls.

You can view POSIX-1.2001, with 2004 Corrigendum, online for free here:
    http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/toc.htm

=== Banned functions ===

The following C99/POSIX functions are BANNED.  They are unsafe, tending to
cause buffer overruns and (all too often) exploitable security holes:

* strcpy, strncpy, strcat:  Use strlcpy and strlcat instead.
* sprintf, vsprintf: use snprintf and vsnprintf instead.
* In scanf and friends, the %s format without length limit is banned.
* strtok: use strtok_r() or unroll this into the obvious loop.
* gets: Use fgets instead. 
* gmtime(), localtime(), asctime(), ctime(): use the reentrant *_r variants.
* tmpnam() - use mkstemp() or tmpfile() instead.
* dirname() - the Linux version is re-entrant but this property is not portable.

In general, avoid functions that are non-reentrant.  When in doubt, see
http://www.unix.org/whitepapers/reentrant.html[Thread-safety and POSIX.1]

=== Naming conventions ===

Every binary and script we install has an "ntp" prefix on the name,
because namespace pollution is rude.  If you write a new tool that you
want us to install, follow this convention.

Generally we favor "ntp" rather than "ntp-" for consistency and to
reduce the amount people have to type. Choose tastefully.

=== Well-tempered output ===

We are devotees of the Unix rule that programs should play nicely
with other programs.  We like output formats that are simple,
regular, and machine-parseable without ambiguity. The practical
goal to aim at, given our choice of scripting languages, is
is to make writing script wrappers in Python easy.

There is more than one way to arrange this.  If you can design a
simple tabular output format, or something resembling an RF2822 header
that's easy for both human eyes and programs to parse, do that.
Besides being simple, formats like these are easily handled by either
Python or shellscripts.

Such simplicity is often difficult or impractical for heterogenous
data that needs to be both grouped and labeled, so we have another
convention for those cases. Here it is:

Wherever it is reasonable, tools that generate complex reports to
standard output should be able to emit two formats. The default can be
relatively unstructured multiline text for human eyeballs. There
should also be a -j/--json option that emits a self-describing JSON
object.  You can read about JSON at

	 http://www.json.org/

Be aware that if you present a tool design with a messy output format
and no JSON option it is quite likely to be rejected.

Our preferred format for dates is RFC3339 (a version of ISO8601 for
UTC with some options frozen; full year required, medial T required,
explicit Zulu timezone). Local times should be expressed in ISO8601,
always with full years and timezone offset.

=== Copyrights and licenses ===

Much of the historic code in this distribution is under an "NTP
License" resembling BSD-2-clause.  Our favored licenses are
BSD-2-clause for code and Creative Commons Attribute 4.0 License for
documentation.

Please do *not* submit code under GPL or other licenses which place
conditions on derived works; we cannot accept such code.

We use the SPDX convention for inclusion by reference  You can read
about this at

      http://spdx.org/licenses

When you create a new file, mark it as follows (updating the year)
as required:

------------------------------------------------
/* Copyright 2015 by the NTPsec project contributors
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-2-Clause
 */
------------------------------------------------

For documentation:

------------------------------------------------
// Copyright 2015 by the NTPsec project contributors
// SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0
------------------------------------------------

Modify as needed for whatever comment syntax the language or markup uses.
Good places for these markings are at the end of an extended
header comment, or at the very top of the file.

When you modify a file, leave existing copyrights in place -
especially all references to Dr. Dave Mills, to Mr Harlan Stenn, and
to the Network Time Foundation.

You *may* add a project copyright and replace the inline license
with an SPDX tag. For example:

------------------------------------------------
/* Copyright 2015 by the NTPsec project contributors
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: NTP
 */
------------------------------------------------

We recognize that occasionally a file may have changed so much that
the historic copyright is no longer appropriate, but such decisions
cannot be made casually. Discuss it with the project management
before moving.

=== Documentation format and structure ===

All our documentation is mastered in asciidoc.  That includes internal
documentation like this file. We do this because asciidoc is easy to
edit and gives us good options for rendering to multiple formats,
including both HTML and Unix manual pages

If you're going to write in anything else you need to have a good
reason, and the bar for "good" will be set high.  "I like Markdown",
in particular, does not qualify - it doesn't have good enough table
support for our needs.  ReST does, but the hassle costs of supporting
two different master markups are too high.

The NTP Classic documentation had a terrible problem with duplicative
documentation gradually diverging as the duplicates mutated and
bitrotted. Therefore one of our house rules is to have a *single point
of truth* for everything.

Accordingly, the way we handle pairs of manual and Web pages that
need to have the same content is to have both be thin wrappers around
a large common include file. These includes live in docs/includes
and are probably what you need to edit if you're updating anything
that appears on a man page.

Most manual-page masters actually have the extension *.txt.in.  The
.in part is a convention for files that need to be macroexpanded as a
first stage for processing.  The reason for this is that asciidoc
becomes syntactically confused if inclusion directives collide with
its parser's idea of where the next section header should be.  We use
the build system to patch around this problem.

=== Conventions for #ifdef guard names ===

Parts of this code are a thicket of C preprocessor conditionals.
In an attempt to make these halfway comprehensible, we use the
following conventions to distinguish classes of macro names:

ENABLE_*::
	Gates the code for an optional feature.  Set by a switch on
	the "waf configure" invocation.

GUARD_*::
	Symbols with thie GUARD_ prefix are idempotency guards - that is,
	they're used to nullify inclusions of a header file
	after the first. They don't interact with the build system's
	configuration logic in any way at all.

HAVE_*_H::
	Guard symbol derived by configuration logic from checking
	for the presence of a system header.  For example, the symbol
	HAVE_SYS_FOOBAR_H gets defined only if waf configure detects
	the presence of a sys/foobar.h in the system include directory.

HAVE_*::
	Without an H suffix, a HAVE symbol is set on the availability
	of a specified function in the system libraries.

NEED_*::
	Need symbols conditionalize porting hacks the need for which
	cannot be detected by checking for a system header or
	function, but instead have to be probed for by some ad-hoc
	test in waf configure.

OVERRIDE_*::
	Override a default for debugging purposes. These are values
	(buffer lengths and the like) which waf is not expected to
	normally override but which might need to be forced.

USE_*::
	Use symbols are set internally within other conditionals to
	gate use of sections of code that must be conditionally
	compiled deoending on *combinations* of HAVE and NEED symbols.

=== Cross-platform portability ===

Do not bake in any assumptions about 32-vs-64-bit word size.  It is OK
to assume the code will never run on a 16-bit machine.  When in doubt,
use the fixed-width integral types from <stdint.h>.

Do not assume any particular endianness. When in doubt, use
htons()/htonl()/ntohs()/ntohl() and do your bit-bashing in network
(big-endian) byte order.

Do not assume anything about sign-bit interpretation in chars.  Target
machines may have either signed or unsigned characters.

Do not rely on assumptions about how structure or unions are padded.

Do not assume pointers can be cast to ints, or vice-versa.  While this
is true on effectively all modern hardware, the code runs on some
sufficiently old iron that this is not necessarily the case even if
the compiler and toolchain have been modernized.

=== Coding style and indentation ==

Dr. Dave Mills likes this code indented formatted in a consistent way.
The file "dot.emacs" has the emacs C-mode indentation style that Dave likes.

=== Other languages ===

The only scripting languages allowed and supported are POSIX sh and
Python 2.5. If you find code in the distribution that is in a
scripting language and not one of these, you would be doing us a
favor by translating it into Python or sh.

The reason for this policy is not that we hate all other scripting
languages, it's to reduce the complexity of maintenance and testing
due to multiple languages.

== Patch and change-comment conventions ==

=== Patch format ===

Please submit patches as git format-patch patches *only*.  This ensures that
your change comment and attribution will be properly imported.

If for some reason it is impossible for you to use git format-patch, at least
send context (-c) or unified (-u) diffs rather than the default ed (-e) style,
which is very brittle.

=== Commit comments ===

And please follow git conventions for change comments. That means your comment
should consist of:

* A summary line, never more than 69 characters long and ideally no more than
  50 characters long.  These numbers are set by the window sizes of various
  common web views of git repositories.

* Your summary line should be terse and imperative.  "Fix bug #666" "Add DWIM
  feature" and "Typo repair" are good summary lines.

* If your comment is longer than the summary line, separate it from
  the summary with a blank line.

* The remainder of your comment should be one or more paragraphs line-wrapped at
  72 characters - please do *not* enter entire paragraphs as single lines, it
  makes life more difficult for browsing tools and people viewing the output of
  git format-patch. Bulleted list items are also OK.

* In some cases it may be appropriate to end your summary line with a comma
  or elipsis ("...") to indicate that it runs dictly into a following paragraph.
  You should still try to make the summary self-contained when you do this.

Finally, it is not necessary (and is in fact bad style) to list all
the files a multi-file commit touches in the comment for it.  The
--name-status, --name-only, and --stat options of git log will report
this information to users who want it.  It is still appropriate
to list a file path if you have something specific to say about that
individual file, or if it's the only one touched in a single-file
change and you can easily fit it in the summary line along with your
summary.

Yes, we know the pre-git portions of the history violate some of these.
That was then, this is now.

=== How to refer to previous commits ===

The best (most human-friendly) way to reference a commit is by quoting its
summary line.  If you need to disambiguate, give its date and author.

The worst way is to quote its git hash, because humans are not good at
keeping random strings of hex digits in working memory.  Besides, hashes
will break if the history is ever moved to another VCS or the repository
has to be surgically altered.
