NTP developers.  Some of the files are:

CommitLog-4.1.0	 Changes from 1997 to 2001.

ChangeLog	 Changes from 2001 to mid-2015.  (Temporarily moved back to
		 the root directory until we fix the build to not care where
		 it lives.)

hacking.txt	Notes to folks who want to hack on the code.

TODO            List of items the NTP developers are working on.

WHERE-TO-START	Hints on what to read in order to get a working
		configuration.  Somewhat historical.
