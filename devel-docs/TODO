= TO DO =

== Relatively new items ==

* Remove the clocktypes array in ntp_control.c, it's a SPOT violation.
  The clock type should be set in the static init function of the driver.

* Remove libevent from the tree.  There's no reason not to link to a current
  version of libevent.

* The portability shims for the case where there is no OpenSSL library installed
  are dodgy.  Get rid of them, it's a safe dependency.  The MD5 implementation
  in the in-tree copy of the ISC library can probably go with it.

* Make OpenSSL a required dependenxy and remove the in-tree shims to simulate it.

== Old, sometime ancient stuff ==

      *** IF YOU CAN HELP FIX ANY OF THESE THINGS, PLEASE DO! ***

010402: Look harder at -lm and -lelf - they are needed less and less...

970711: Look Real Hard at changing the key stuff from u_long to u_int32.

970711: Make sure it's safe to convert proto_config's 2nd argument from
	u_long to u_int32.  Watch "set" in ntp_request.c:setclr_flags().

970318: in hourly_stats(?), squawk if the magnitude of the drift is,
	say, >400.

970301: Implement the utmp/wtmp timestamping on time steps.

970210: Find a way to dump the current configuration to either syslog or
	a file.

Problems that need to be fixed:

- Get rid of the old SYS_* macros:
  (It's worth noting that any code that would have been "enabled" by any
  of these macros has not been used since 5.83, and there have been very
  few complaints...)

- config.guess might need help to identify:

  Fujitsu's UXP				--enable-adjtime-is-accurate
					--enable-step-slew

  Unixware				--enable-adjtime-is-accurate
					--enable-tick=10000
					--enable-tickadj=80
					--enable-udp-wildcard
					--disable-step-slew

  DomainOS				--enable-adjtime-is-accurate
					--disable-kmem
					--enable-tick=1000000

  OpenVMS				--enable-slew-always
					--enable-hourly-todr-sync

  Is adjtime accurate on ALL sysv4* machines?
  Can we identify DomainOS with *-apollo-* ?
  Do we catch all Unixware machines with *-univel-sysv* ?

- Combine enable-step-slew and enable-ntpdate-step

- Make sure enable-hourly-todr-sync is always disabled
  What about NextStep and OpenVMS, where hourly TODR sync used to be enabled?

- Check dcfd.c for variables that need to be volatile.
