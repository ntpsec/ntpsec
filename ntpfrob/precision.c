/* Find the resolution of the system clock by watching how the current time
 * changes as we read it repeatedly.
 *
 * struct timeval is only good to 1us, which may cause problems as machines
 * get faster, but until then the logic goes:
 *
 * If a machine has resolution (i.e. accurate timing info) > 1us, then it will
 * probably use the "unused" low order bits as a counter (to force time to be
 * a strictly increaing variable), incrementing it each time any process
 * requests the time [[ or maybe time will stand still ? ]].
 *
 * SO: the logic goes:
 *
 *      IF      the difference from the last time is "small" (< MINSTEP)
 *      THEN    this machine is "counting" with the low order bits
 *      ELIF    this is not the first time round the loop
 *      THEN    this machine *WAS* counting, and has now stepped
 *      ELSE    this machine has resolution < time to read clock
 *
 * SO: if it exits on the first loop, assume "full accuracy" (1us)
 *     otherwise, take the log2(observered difference, rounded UP)
 *
 * MINLOOPS > 1 ensures that even if there is a STEP between the initial call
 * and the first loop, it doesn't stop too early.
 * Making it even greater allows MINSTEP to be reduced, assuming that the
 * chance of MINSTEP-1 other processes getting in and calling clock_gettime()
 * between this processes's calls.
 * Reducing MINSTEP may be necessary as this sets an upper bound for the time
 * to actually call clock_gettime().
